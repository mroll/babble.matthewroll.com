A project to write a million words. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if those words are good, mediocre, amazing, or awful. It just matters that they exist. Because if they exist, it means I forced my brain to make a million words come out of my brain, through my fingers and the keyboard, into a computer, and onto the internet. And if that has happened, then I&amp;rsquo;ve probably learned a few things about myself, about writing, about consistency, about practice.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 09:04:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/about/</guid><description>This is a project to write 1,000,000 words.
I feel like I have a lot to say, both because there are things I want to share and because there are things I think I will only figure out through the course of writing.
But at the moment it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to get ideas out of my head and onto the page. The ideas in my head feel like water, and they are trying to flow downstream to the page, but the stream is not wide enough, or there is blockage, like sticks and leaves keeping the idea-water from moving quickly through the channel.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/archives/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/archives/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
