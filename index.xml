Like it&amp;rsquo;s actually an extension of your body or mind and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird because we are all on the same internet and so we share this extension of our mind.
Everyone has different experiences on the internet, so it&amp;rsquo;s not the same extension for everyone.</description></item><item><title>012 - Changing Yourself If It Makes Sense</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 09:26:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</guid><description>When I was a kid I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had much sense of identity. I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;rational agency&amp;rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</description></item><item><title>011 - Living in the Moment</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 08:56:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m that good at living in the moment. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m not that good at it. I&amp;rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&amp;rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</description></item><item><title>010 - Body Image</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:14:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/</guid><description>Body image is something I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had to think serious about before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</description></item><item><title>009 - Food Management</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/009-food-management/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 13:28:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/009-food-management/</guid><description>Food is one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s just in the background of life. For me, at least. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&amp;rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</description></item><item><title>008 - The Internet Is Magic</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/008-the-internet-is-magic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 16:11:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/008-the-internet-is-magic/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 3:49pm on a Friday and I&amp;rsquo;m so tired but I feel like I just want to write a word vomit. It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&amp;rsquo;ll be more with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</description></item><item><title>007 - Pseudonymity</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/007-pseudonymity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 12:01:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/007-pseudonymity/</guid><description>Pseudonymity is being known under a name different than your given name. When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &amp;ldquo;birth name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;given name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;state name&amp;rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &amp;ldquo;Matt Roll&amp;rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.</description></item><item><title>006 - Hobbies</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/006-hobbies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:00:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/006-hobbies/</guid><description>I definitely like the idea of hobbies. Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</description></item><item><title>005 - Making Friends</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 21:09:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had friends, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never put much effort into making friends. Ah, ok, that&amp;rsquo;s already not true. In eighth grade I decided for some deranged reason that only makes sense in the mind of a teenager that I wanted to be popular. And so I started putting a lot of effort into becoming friends with the popular kids. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure at this point how I bootstrapped that endeavor.</description></item><item><title>004 - Crypto</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/004-crypto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 15:05:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/004-crypto/</guid><description>When I got to college in 2012 I had already read Cryptonomicon and it was my favorite book. At some point that year I also found out about bitcoin, which was obviously like the ideas in Cryptonomicon manifest in the real world. Real world digital gold. I thought it was really cool, and I tried to download the software and start mining bitcoin from my laptop in my freshman dorm room.</description></item><item><title>003 - Coffee</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/003-coffee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 09:38:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/003-coffee/</guid><description>Coffee went from being something I knew about but had no experience with, to a daily ritual and something I have a real love for, in like the span of a couple months. It was freshman year of college, and the dining hall had free coffee, and I would take it with some cream and sugar. My friend Joe and I would kind of bond over coffee, I think he was already a coffee drinker and the reason I took an interest to it might have been a way to have something we could share and talk about.</description></item><item><title>002 - Education</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/002-education/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 22:02:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/002-education/</guid><description>I want to write about education because I think I bundle too many ideas into that word, and I want to tease them apart. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any coherent positions on &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; mostly because it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any crisp meaning in my head.
Ok, what are the concepts that I associate with the word &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;?
First is the school system in the United States. I get a sort of visual of lots of different school units spread over a large geography when I think of the term &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s how my mind manifests the idea of the United States primary school system.</description></item><item><title>001 - Why am I writing?</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/hello/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 09:04:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/hello/</guid><description>This is the first post in a 1,000 post project. A project to write a million words. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if those words are good, mediocre, amazing, or awful. It just matters that they exist. Because if they exist, it means I forced my brain to make a million words come out of my brain, through my fingers and the keyboard, into a computer, and onto the internet. And if that has happened, then I&amp;rsquo;ve probably learned a few things about myself, about writing, about consistency, about practice.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 09:04:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/about/</guid><description>This is a project to write 1,000,000 words.
I feel like I have a lot to say, both because there are things I want to share and because there are things I think I will only figure out through the course of writing.
But at the moment it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to get ideas out of my head and onto the page. The ideas in my head feel like water, and they are trying to flow downstream to the page, but the stream is not wide enough, or there is blockage, like sticks and leaves keeping the idea-water from moving quickly through the channel.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/archives/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/archives/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
