Maybe less, but it feels like a long time. I was doing them really consistently for more than a month so going more than like 2-3 days feels like ages.
Which is good, because it means I&rsquo;m noticing the lack of them in my routine and it&rsquo;s making me want to come back to writing them. I think that&rsquo;s the sign of a habit that will stick around for a while.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 21, 2021</time>

It&rsquo;s a phrase I invoke when someone is not sure that we&rsquo;re doing the right thing because results haven&rsquo;t materialized yet. And the idea behind trusting the process is that the process make sense from first principles. The results will come because we can predict from first principles that this process will generate those results.
It&rsquo;s a good mental model for doing things that take a long time.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 10, 2021</time>

I thought it would be good to do a reflection on what it&rsquo;s been like so far.
For starters, I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;m still doing it! I start lots of projects and I also quit lots of projects before they become anything significant. I know it&rsquo;s all relative, but writing 25,000 words of stream of consciousness journalling over the course of about a month is significant to me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 8, 2021</time>

I&rsquo;m kind of settling into my &ldquo;explore&rdquo; phase. I wrote about this a few entries back, but basically I want to spend some time looking for the next fulfilling thing to do with my life.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 4, 2021</time>

As it to say you would have been able to do a good job, if it were not for the short comings of these tools which you did not make and so are not accountable for.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 29, 2021</time>

Or I guess even just someone who has been reading a lot for a while. It makes them different than other people. I&rsquo;m not sure what the difference is, but I feel like it&rsquo;s real.
Now, reading a lot is relative. I think I used to read a lot, probably hit 40 or 50 books a year at my peak in late middle school, early high school.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 29, 2021</time>

At least in the way I&rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 27, 2021</time>

You need to have a game to play. You need to have something that you like doing and that can fit the model of an infinite game.
Because the core part of being an infinite game player is that you enjoy the game so much that you just want to keep playing it.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 25, 2021</time>

Maybe you could build like a commune of infinite game players and not have to encounter any finite game players, but then you&rsquo;d be cutting yourself off from much of the world and it&rsquo;s not worth it.
No, you have to play finite games with finite game players.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 22, 2021</time>

It&rsquo;s one of the ideas that I&rsquo;m working my way around and through in mind my recently, because I think really understanding it will do a lot for my happiness and sense of fulfillment in life.
It will also probably help me figure out what to work on.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 22, 2021</time>
