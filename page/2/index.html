036 - The Writing Brain I'm Trying to Build
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is a type of brain that can just push words out onto the page at an alarming rate with relative ease. I want that brain. I don&rsquo;t currently have that brain, but this project is me putting time and energy directly toward a future where that is the brain I have. I just think there is so much interesting stuff that gets lost because only so much can fit inside your head and so you eventually forget and move onto other interesting things without properly documenting what you were thinking about previously.</p>

035 - Writing Fiction
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiction is what got me into reading. As a kid I fell in love with stories written down as words on pages. I think this is a pretty common theme among people who love reading, but something about books is magical. And I saw that magic early on.
At some point, I think maybe it was middle school, I got into science fiction. I don&rsquo;t know what the first science fiction I read was.</p>

034 - Identity as a Writer
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>What makes someone &ldquo;a writer.&rdquo; Like, being &ldquo;a writer&rdquo; is an occupation, certainly. If you have been paid for something you wrote then you can consider yourself a writer. Actually as I write that I realize that I have been paid for something I wrote: $100 BTC for a blog post reviewing Balaji Srinivasan&rsquo;s post on network states.
If you get paid to write a book, or if you are regularly paid to write articles for a website, you are a writer.</p>

033 - Moving
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>We just decided, yesterday, to move to New York City a month earlier than we had originally planned. Actually maybe two months earlier? Anyway, the point is we are starting the process right now, like today. We are selling most of our stuff, packing up the rest, and leaving California at the end of June. We are not coming back. Our apartment will be leased until the end of September, but we just want to get out and get to the city as soon as possible.</p>

032 - Figuring Out Life
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a cultural meme where I come from that it takes a long time to figure out life. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a cultural meme everywhere, and certainly not for all of time. Like there are cultures, and there have been times, where for the majority if not all people, what they will do in life is pretty much set from the time they are born.
Is figuring out life a relatively new concept?</p>

031 - Gamification
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>You know every time I go to write one of these word vomits I get a little bit nervous. Like a little bit scared. I think it comes from a fear that I won&rsquo;t have enough to say, or that it will take too much effort or too much time to write a thousands words.
Which is a little weird considering I&rsquo;ve done thirty of these so far and none of them have been that hard.</p>

030 - Wanting to Live Multiple Lives
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a bummer that you can only live one life. At least as far as I know you can only live one life. I assume if reincarnation were a thing then I wouldn&rsquo;t be the first instance of the my being. My experience is that I have no past lives, and so I don&rsquo;t expect to have future lives.
I mean maybe there could be reincarnation if it worked in a way that when you are living a life you don&rsquo;t remember your past lives, and like when you die in one life maybe there is like an intermediate period where you return to your full, complete self in the void and you remember all of the lives that you&rsquo;ve lived until that moment, and then you go into another life.</p>

029 - When Things Actually Work Out
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange feeling &ndash; an amazing feeling, to be sure &ndash; when something that a few months ago you wished you had you suddenly have. My experience with this is not universal, but I feel like it&rsquo;s probably in the majority. In my life, several things that I&rsquo;ve really wanted to happen have happened, but probably more have not happened.
I did not go to a D1 college to play tennis.</p>

028 - Vacation

</h2>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like two weeks since I did a word vomit. Maybe less, but it feels like a long time. I was doing them really consistently for more than a month so going more than like 2-3 days feels like ages.
Which is good, because it means I&rsquo;m noticing the lack of them in my routine and it&rsquo;s making me want to come back to writing them. I think that&rsquo;s the sign of a habit that will stick around for a while.</p>

027 - Trusting the Process
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I&rsquo;m a really big fan of trusting the process. It&rsquo;s a phrase I invoke when someone is not sure that we&rsquo;re doing the right thing because results haven&rsquo;t materialized yet. And the idea behind trusting the process is that the process make sense from first principles. The results will come because we can predict from first principles that this process will generate those results.
It&rsquo;s a good mental model for doing things that take a long time.</p>
