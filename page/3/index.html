I&rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not that good at it. I&rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 8, 2021</time>

I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 6, 2021</time>

For me, at least. I realize that&rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 4, 2021</time>

It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&rsquo;ll be more with it. I&rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 2, 2021</time>

When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &ldquo;birth name&rdquo; or &ldquo;given name&rdquo; or &ldquo;state name&rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &ldquo;Matt Roll&rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 2, 2021</time>

Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 30, 2021</time>

Ah, ok, that&rsquo;s already not true. In eighth grade I decided for some deranged reason that only makes sense in the mind of a teenager that I wanted to be popular. And so I started putting a lot of effort into becoming friends with the popular kids. I&rsquo;m not even sure at this point how I bootstrapped that endeavor.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 29, 2021</time>

At some point that year I also found out about bitcoin, which was obviously like the ideas in Cryptonomicon manifest in the real world. Real world digital gold. I thought it was really cool, and I tried to download the software and start mining bitcoin from my laptop in my freshman dorm room.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 27, 2021</time>

It was freshman year of college, and the dining hall had free coffee, and I would take it with some cream and sugar. My friend Joe and I would kind of bond over coffee, I think he was already a coffee drinker and the reason I took an interest to it might have been a way to have something we could share and talk about.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 26, 2021</time>

I don&rsquo;t have any coherent positions on &ldquo;education&rdquo; mostly because it just doesn&rsquo;t have any crisp meaning in my head.
Ok, what are the concepts that I associate with the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;?
First is the school system in the United States. I get a sort of visual of lots of different school units spread over a large geography when I think of the term &ldquo;education&rdquo;, and I think that&rsquo;s how my mind manifests the idea of the United States primary school system.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 25, 2021</time>
