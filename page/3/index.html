024 - Is It a Poor Craftsman That Blames His Tools
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is this saying that &ldquo;It is a poor craftsman that blames his tools.&rdquo; I think it means that having done a poor job at something, it is a bad excuse to blame the tools you were using to do the job. As it to say you would have been able to do a good job, if it were not for the short comings of these tools which you did not make and so are not accountable for.</p>

023 - What Is It About Reading
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is something about people that grew up reading a lot. Or I guess even just someone who has been reading a lot for a while. It makes them different than other people. I&rsquo;m not sure what the difference is, but I feel like it&rsquo;s real.
Now, reading a lot is relative. I think I used to read a lot, probably hit 40 or 50 books a year at my peak in late middle school, early high school.</p>

022 - Strategy, Goals, and Tactics
</a>

<div>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a sort of quiet period in my life where I&rsquo;m not building anything. At least in the way I&rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</p>

021 - It's Not Enough to Understand Infinite Games
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Once you understand the concept of an infinite game, it&rsquo;s not like you can just start playing one because you like the idea of it. You need to have a game to play. You need to have something that you like doing and that can fit the model of an infinite game.
Because the core part of being an infinite game player is that you enjoy the game so much that you just want to keep playing it.</p>

020 - You Still Have to Play Finite Games
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Even if you are an inifinite game player and fully grasp the continuum of chained finite games that comprise your domain, you still have to play finite games with finite game players. Maybe you could build like a commune of infinite game players and not have to encounter any finite game players, but then you&rsquo;d be cutting yourself off from much of the world and it&rsquo;s not worth it.
No, you have to play finite games with finite game players.</p>

019 - Infinite Games

<div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned infinite games a few times before in word vomits, but I realize I haven&rsquo;t dedicated a whole one to that concept yet. It&rsquo;s about time, I&rsquo;d say. It&rsquo;s one of the ideas that I&rsquo;m working my way around and through in mind my recently, because I think really understanding it will do a lot for my happiness and sense of fulfillment in life.
It will also probably help me figure out what to work on.</p>

018 - Slack as Necessary Ingredient
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>This week at work is a return to the idea that slack is a necessary ingredient for outsized success. There are a lot of things I see around work that can be improved. And that it wouldn&rsquo;t even be that hard to improve them. Just some focused and careful thought to research and design solutions, and then some straightforward implementation.
I&rsquo;m talking about like code review tools, static analysis, performance improvements in different areas of the data pipeline, development process improvements like automated deploys and faster builds, etc etc etc.</p>

017 - More on Play

</h2>
<div>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to make any big leaps with this idea of implementing play in the rest of my life, I&rsquo;m going to have to do real thinking about it. Like, what does it apply to? how do I incorporate it? does incorporating it in different parts of life look different? what does it mean for my relationships with other people? will it change my demeanor and be weird for those around me?</p>

016 - Exploring Playfulness

<p>I was not expecting to make any sort of breakthrough when I was writing yesterday. I was kind of thinking to myself over the past few days &ldquo;when are you supposed to see results?&rdquo; about this writing thing. This word vomit thing. Visa says it helped him work out a bunch of personal issues like self-confidence and self-love. Basically when I got like the tenth one, I started wondering how it would happen.</p>

015 - Need to Learn How to Play

<div>
<p>I feel like the central tension in my life is not feeling like I&rsquo;m working towards the right thing. I don&rsquo;t know what the right thing is, and maybe I am doing things that are bringing me closer to it, but it doesn&rsquo;t always feel like it.
Maybe it felt like it when I won the $100 BTC from the most recent 1729 task. Because one thing I want to be good at is writing on the internet, and winning money by writing good things on the internet seems like nice validation of that goal.</p>
