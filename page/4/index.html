018 - Slack as Necessary Ingredient
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>This week at work is a return to the idea that slack is a necessary ingredient for outsized success. There are a lot of things I see around work that can be improved. And that it wouldn&rsquo;t even be that hard to improve them. Just some focused and careful thought to research and design solutions, and then some straightforward implementation.
I&rsquo;m talking about like code review tools, static analysis, performance improvements in different areas of the data pipeline, development process improvements like automated deploys and faster builds, etc etc etc.</p>

017 - More on Play

</h2>
<div>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to make any big leaps with this idea of implementing play in the rest of my life, I&rsquo;m going to have to do real thinking about it. Like, what does it apply to? how do I incorporate it? does incorporating it in different parts of life look different? what does it mean for my relationships with other people? will it change my demeanor and be weird for those around me?</p>

016 - Exploring Playfulness

<p>I was not expecting to make any sort of breakthrough when I was writing yesterday. I was kind of thinking to myself over the past few days &ldquo;when are you supposed to see results?&rdquo; about this writing thing. This word vomit thing. Visa says it helped him work out a bunch of personal issues like self-confidence and self-love. Basically when I got like the tenth one, I started wondering how it would happen.</p>

015 - Need to Learn How to Play
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel like the central tension in my life is not feeling like I&rsquo;m working towards the right thing. I don&rsquo;t know what the right thing is, and maybe I am doing things that are bringing me closer to it, but it doesn&rsquo;t always feel like it.
Maybe it felt like it when I won the $100 BTC from the most recent 1729 task. Because one thing I want to be good at is writing on the internet, and winning money by writing good things on the internet seems like nice validation of that goal.</p>

014 - Activation Energy
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is this concept of activation energy that seems super important to me, and activation energy actually describes it pretty well, but I don&rsquo;t see people talking about it very much (if at all, can&rsquo;t recall any examples), and definitely don&rsquo;t see people using this metaphor.
What is &ldquo;activation energy&rdquo; in this context? It&rsquo;s the energy you need to muster to start doing some task. Usually it&rsquo;s a work thing, like sitting down to work in the morning, or doing a chore like washing the dishes, or doing your taxes, or working out.</p>

013 - Is The Internet A Cybernetic Appendage
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Some people make this reference to an idea that the internet, or actually maybe more often the referent is the phone, anyway that this thing is a cybernetic appendage. Like it&rsquo;s actually an extension of your body or mind and it&rsquo;s kind of weird because we are all on the same internet and so we share this extension of our mind.
Everyone has different experiences on the internet, so it&rsquo;s not the same extension for everyone.</p>

012 - Changing Yourself If It Makes Sense
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>When I was a kid I don&rsquo;t think I had much sense of identity. I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &ldquo;free will&rdquo; or &ldquo;rational agency&rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that good at living in the moment. I&rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not that good at it. I&rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</p>

<p>Body image is something I haven&rsquo;t really had to think serious about before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</p>

009 - Food Management

<div>
<p>Food is one of those things that&rsquo;s just in the background of life. For me, at least. I realize that&rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</p>
