name. When I think about names, and being known under a different name
than my &ldquo;birth name&rdquo; or &ldquo;given name&rdquo; or &ldquo;state name&rdquo;, I realize that
names are not special. Like, &ldquo;Matt Roll&rdquo; is not more special than some
name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe
there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more
special than some name I make up and use to talk to people
online. Reason being I can like get a bank account and get hired and
rent an apartment and buy a house and all that with my given name. And
I can&rsquo;t do that with my Twitter handle.</p><p>But all that is changing.</p><p>Crypto means I can make up a name and act under it online, and even in
the real world I think, and have the same capabilities as my given
name. I like calling it &ldquo;state name&rdquo; because that makes it clear who
cares about the name. The state. The government. The Man. Fuck the
Man.</p><p>The Man keeps track of your credit score and refuses you opportunities
if it&rsquo;s not good enough. There are surely better ways of assessing
peoples' ability to pay a debt over time. When I had just graduated
college, I had never had a credit card. The idea of spending money I
didn&rsquo;t have just seemed so dumb. Like, why would anyone ever do that?
What if something happened and you couldn&rsquo;t pay it back in time? That
would just be awful and it&rsquo;s just so avoidable.</p><p>Anyway. Pseudonymity. I&rsquo;m still breaking my mind into the concept. I&rsquo;m
still not completely there yet. Haven&rsquo;t grasped all the
implications. There are many. It changes your understanding of the
world, and how you view yourself, and what you think are reasonable
ways of acting and speaking and working in public.</p><p>Let me try to explain. In the professional working world, especially
now that that world is majorly online, there is a reputation
associated with your state name. You use your state name on your
LinkedIn profile. Lots of people have Twitter accounts that use their
state name, and they use those accounts to accumulate reputation
points. Basically, are you saying smart things that don&rsquo;t cross the
Overton Window boundaries too hard?</p><p>If you take peoples' online personas as they are represented in these
places alongside their state names, you get a certain picture of who
they are and what they believe. But that is an imperfect model for a
very specific and important reason: they are only saying what they
think is ok to say and have be associated with their state name. Their
livelihood and their social standing, and their safety in many cases,
is dependent on the reputation associated with their state name.</p><p>So there is a massively powerful filter that is invisibly sitting
between peoples' brains and what they put out online under their state
name.</p><p>That&rsquo;s obviously imperfect! At no point in history has the Overton
Window been a one-to-one mapping with the set of true ideas. If you
only allow conversation that discusses things that are acceptable
given the current political climate, then you are going to miss true
ideas, and you are going to settle on untrue ideas. There is some
formal set theory that I&rsquo;m gesturing at here but this is a word vomit
and I&rsquo;m not going to take the time to develop it here. But it&rsquo;s there.</p><p>Anyway. What does this have to do with pseudonymity? Well, if you have
important things to say that you don&rsquo;t want to associate with your
state name, you create a pseudonym. You create an alt twitter account,
you create a blog and don&rsquo;t put your real name on it, you create a
substack and don&rsquo;t put your real name on it. This is actually a really
powerful idea and it&rsquo;s not new. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison
and other wrote <em>The Federalist Papers</em> as pseudonymous essays in
order to avoid the consequences of publishing under their state names.</p><p>So if it&rsquo;s not a new idea, why do I care about it now? One reason is
that I&rsquo;m just now figuring out how I want to present myself in public
on the internet. I certainly think things that I want to publish but I
don&rsquo;t want to publish under my state name. There is a certain audience
I have in mind when I publish things under my state name. I carefully
curate the things I say to that audience, because that affects how
those people see me, and the way those people see me influences my
professional opportunities which are rather important to me at the
moment, not being rich yet.</p><p>But yeah so I have things I want to say that I don&rsquo;t want people to
see associated with my state name. And the answer seems to be
pseudonymous accounts. Make a Twitter account with a name and
aesthetic you like, and start posting a more unfiltered stream under
that name.</p><p>I always think of Valentine and Peter posting as Demosthenes and Locke
from Ender&rsquo;s Game.</p><p>Ok there is another reason why I think this is an important topic
now. Crypto is coming into its own. It&rsquo;s still super early, to be
sure, and lots of the foundational technology is still to be figured
out, but the ideas are there and we can start to see what the world
will look like when these ideas spread and the tech becomes
mainstream.</p><p>Crypto means you can own a name in a way that has not been possible
before. Crypto makes it harder to steal identities than the current
state based system that relies on social security numbers and knowing
your address and shit. If you cryptographically own a name, then there
is no question that it&rsquo;s you acting under that name.</p><p>Now ok, maybe identity theft is not such a big problem that crypto
will revolutionize things in this way. But there&rsquo;s another
reason. Crypto means you can transfer reputation. If you build up a
bunch of reputation under your state name (or another name, doesn&rsquo;t
matter), you can transfer that reputation to a pseudonym where you say
unfiltered and controversial things, and people will take them
seriously because the reputation is there. And the reputation is
unfakable. A lot of reputation means people have trusted and/or
enjoyed the things you have said, even under many different names.</p><p>It means you can consolidate reputation. Like, maybe you have X
reputation under your state name, and Y reputation under a name that
advocates for Uighur rights in China, and you live in China, so
obviously you&rsquo;re not saying these things under your state name. That
would be suicide. You can transfer your Y Uighur-advocating reputation
to your state account to augment that reputation, and you can transfer
your X state name reputation to your Uighur-advocating account to
augment that. And so the work that you do under both accounts is
counted for both accounts.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=/tags/pseudonymity>#pseudonymity</a>
