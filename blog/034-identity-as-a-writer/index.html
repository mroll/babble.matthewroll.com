<h1 class=post-title>034 - Identity as a Writer</h1>
<time>May 27, 2021</time>
<div>
<p>
<p>What makes someone &ldquo;a writer.&rdquo; Like, being &ldquo;a writer&rdquo; is an
occupation, certainly. If you have been paid for something you wrote
then you can consider yourself a writer. Actually as I write that I
realize that I have been paid for something I wrote: $100 BTC for a
blog post reviewing Balaji Srinivasan&rsquo;s post on network states.</p>
<p>If you get paid to write a book, or if you are regularly paid to write
articles for a website, you are a writer. Maybe a more general and
elegant criteria is &ldquo;you make your living by writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a comprehensive definition. Scott Alexander is
certainly a writer, but he doesn&rsquo;t make his living from writing&mldr; oh
shit, actually since moving to Substack he actually does.</p>
<p>But long before that move, he was most certainly &ldquo;a writer.&rdquo; So there
has to be something else that measures someone&rsquo;s writer-ness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think there is a hard objective definition that you
can come up with here. It&rsquo;s just interesting for me to play around
with this idea of identity as a writer because I&rsquo;m trying to see how I
think of myself in terms of the writing I do. Or, a better way to
phrase it is &ldquo;how I think about the part my writing plays in my
conception of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think I am a man of words. Whatever that means. I&rsquo;m someone who, in
my own head, lives in the realm of ideas. That&rsquo;s in contrast to living
in the realm of emotions or the realm of politics or the realm of
status.</p>
<p>And in my mind writing is the medium in which ideas travel. Ideas
travel from person to person. I&rsquo;m not sure I would consider an idea
real if it hasn&rsquo;t made the jump from one mind to another. Ehh, maybe
that&rsquo;s a little too strict. I do think solutions to physics problems
or math problems are real even when they are just known to one person.</p>
<p>But writing is the medium of ideas, and I live in the realm of ideas,
and so in one sense I live in writing. This sounds a little absurd but
I can&rsquo;t really deny it. So much of what I consider my identity comes
from ideas that I have mostly encountered through books. Whether it&rsquo;s
story books or textbooks. Or essays and blog posts online.</p>
<p>I am a person built from ideas I found out in the world.</p>
<p>Getting a little off topic (is that possible when there is no
topic?). I want to think about my writing. I&rsquo;ve written over thirty
thousand words in the past two months, so on one hand I am producing a
lot of writing. Does that make me a writer? It doesn&rsquo;t really feel
that way to me. It <em>almost</em> feels that way to me. But not quite. This
isn&rsquo;t <em>serious</em> writing. This is just garbage. No one wants to read
this.</p>
<p>Ah, there&rsquo;s another definition of writer. Someone whose writing is
read by other people. And like the more people that read your writing,
the more serious you are. Although that doesn&rsquo;t quite hold up, because
more people read John Grisham than Jane Austen, but is Grisham a more
serious writer?</p>
<p>No, maybe it&rsquo;s like a binary thing, where you get to a certain number
of people reading your writing and then you&rsquo;re a writer. I think that
number could be quite low, like if ten people read your writing on a
regular basis, then you are a writer.</p>
<p>Oh shit, does this mean everyone on Twitter is a writer? That kind of
punctures a hole in this definition, because I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the
quality of &ldquo;writer&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m going for. I want to say the writing has
to be more serious, but what does that mean? Is it just longer? Like
would 500 words be enough to qualify as a piece that if more than ten
people read then you&rsquo;re a writer?</p>
<p>At this point it&rsquo;s just getting ridiculous and is making me want to
say &ldquo;who cares if the phrase &ldquo;a writer&rdquo; describes you?&rdquo; If you want to
write, just fucking write. And that makes me a lot more
comfortable. Just shoving off all that expectation of living up to a
definition. I don&rsquo;t want to live up to such a nebulous definition. It
just means whatever the person saying it wants it to mean.</p>
<p>But I do want to do a certain kind of writing. I want to write essays,
I think. Like, essays on interesting and deep topics that have
something to do with the real world. That draw on history and lived
experience and research. That together make up a real respectable body
of work.</p>
<p>I know I can do this. I can think critically about things and make
interesting connections and come to useful conclusions about how to be
in this world, and what certain events mean. But I haven&rsquo;t found
something that really pulls me in and makes me want to write a lot
about. Maybe because I haven&rsquo;t looked. That&rsquo;s the most likely
answer. I kind of got to the step of &ldquo;yeah, I want to write essays&rdquo;
and haven&rsquo;t done the next step of going out and looking for things to
write essays about.</p>
<p>Because on some level I think essay ideas should just come to you, and
if they don&rsquo;t then you&rsquo;re boring and dumb and not worthy of writing
essays. I think that&rsquo;s probably not true, like if I go out and find
something I&rsquo;m interested in writing about and then write a good essay,
that kind of proves that theory wrong. And that&rsquo;s totally something I
can see happening.</p>
<p>Some examples of writing that I like the style of are Allen
Farrrington, Alex Danco, Anna Gat. I&rsquo;ve read their blogs recently and
enjoyed the way that writing feels.</p>
<p>Maybe this weekend I will go out to the internet and find something to
write an essay about.</p>
