can just start playing one because you like the idea of it. You need
to have a game to play. You need to have something that you like doing
and that can fit the model of an infinite game.</p><p>Because the core part of being an infinite game player is that you
enjoy the game so much that you just want to keep playing it. And you
forego the entire concept of &ldquo;winning&rdquo; because that would mean at some
point the game stops.</p><p>So the enjoyment of your infinite game is a necessity. You can&rsquo;t just
start playing a game that looks like an infinite game because you want
to be a person who is an infinite game player. That&rsquo;s
performative. It&rsquo;s not the real thing.</p><p>The real thing is to not care about the fact that you are playing an
infinite game because you are too caught up in actually playing
it. Sure, you can understand and accept that you are playing an
infinite game, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be cool to play an infinite game. You
should do it because that&rsquo;s how you want to live your life.</p><p>I&rsquo;m writing this because I think I want to live life as an infinite
game player, but I don&rsquo;t yet have a game. And I don&rsquo;t want to fool
myself into thinking that I can just go around saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing an
infinite game&rdquo; and not have the real thing. Because I think if you
have the real thing then you don&rsquo;t go around saying that, because
again, you don&rsquo;t care for the performative part because you are too
busy playing.</p><p>My problem at the moment, the highest leverage thing I can be working
on right now, is to find an infinite game that I truly
enjoy. Something that I want to play for the rest of my
life. Something that obviates the question &ldquo;what is a productive use
of my time right now?&rdquo; That will never be in question, because if I am
playing the game then I am using my time the way in which I want to be
using it. I won&rsquo;t have to constantly be worrying if I am moving in the
right direction toward my goals, because playing the game is a goal in
and of itself.</p><p>I&rsquo;m at the beginning of this search, and I don&rsquo;t know how long it will
take. A few months at the minimum, I suspect. A few years at the
max. I&rsquo;m at the beginning and so not only don&rsquo;t I know how long it
will take, I don&rsquo;t really know how to go about it.</p><p>The first thing I&rsquo;m doing is separating myself from the need to be
productive all the time. I don&rsquo;t talk about this much to other people,
because I don&rsquo;t really care that people know I have this drive to
always be producing, but it&rsquo;s a constant conversation in my
head. Literally any downtime I have away from external
responsibilities like work or house chores is met with an irresistible
pull to make something. Usually it&rsquo;s writing or coding.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m working on letting that feeling go for a while. Because I
think in order to find a new direction you have to kind of stop and
look around. If you are just ploughing forward on whatever you were
already doing, that keeps your vision narrow and causes you to miss
stuff on your periphery. So that&rsquo;s the first thing I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;m
letting myself have entire days where I don&rsquo;t do anything that could
be reasonably considered &ldquo;working toward my goals.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m entering into
a phase of exploration and away from the exploitation phase that
frankly went on probably too long.</p><p>The first thing I did this weekend to separate myself from this drive
to &ldquo;work&rdquo; was download and start playing this video game called
Maplestory M. It&rsquo;s a mobile version of a game that I spent a lot of
time playing when I was in middle school. Or maybe even elementary
school. It&rsquo;s a 2d side-scroller where you fight monsters to level up
your character and collect weapons and items and go on quests. I like
the aspect of leveling up and getting cool items. Maybe that&rsquo;s kind of
ironic that in trying to move away from being productive in the real
world I have found a way to productive in a virtual world.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also going to watch a bunch of tv. I already watch a fair amount
of tv, but I&rsquo;m pretty much always doing something else while watching,
like writing code. But for a little while I&rsquo;m going to watch tv just
to watch tv. (I&rsquo;m not sure if I can do this actually, the thought of
sitting and watching and not be doing anything else kind of repulses
me at the moment. We will see how this goes.)</p><p>This is just the first phase, the separation phase. I don&rsquo;t think I
should move into an intense exploration phase right away, because I
would probably treat it too much like the exploitation phase where
everything has to be organized and there have to explicit sub goals
and in general there is just far too much structure to have any hope
of finding something that you don&rsquo;t know you are looking for.</p><p>The separation phase will hopefully put me in a frame of mind where
doing things for no stated benefit is ok. My hope is that will make it
possible to go down rabbit holes I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. Which is
necessary if in fact the thing I am looking for is down one of those
rabbit holes.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll just finish by saying I am optimistic about this exercise. I may
not know what I am looking for but I think I know what it will feel
like when I find it. Because I think I understand infinite games
enough to be able to recognize when I&rsquo;m in one. I certainly know what
play looks like and I feel like I know in my core what it feels like
to be in a game that you just don&rsquo;t want to stop playing. Where there
is no concept of winning and losing because playing it is the best
possible state.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=/tags/infinite-games>#infinite games</a>
