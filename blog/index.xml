I don&amp;rsquo;t have any coherent positions on &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; mostly because it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any crisp meaning in my head.
Ok, what are the concepts that I associate with the word &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;?
First is the school system in the United States. I get a sort of visual of lots of different school units spread over a large geography when I think of the term &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s how my mind manifests the idea of the United States primary school system.</description></item><item><title>001 - Why am I writing?</title><link>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/blog/hello/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 09:04:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/blog/hello/</guid><description>This is the first post in a 1,000 post project. A project to write a million words. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if those words are good, mediocre, amazing, or awful. It just matters that they exist. Because if they exist, it means I forced my brain to make a million words come out of my brain, through my fingers and the keyboard, into a computer, and onto the internet. And if that has happened, then I&amp;rsquo;ve probably learned a few things about myself, about writing, about consistency, about practice.</description></item></channel></rss>
