before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good
genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was
like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I
started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I
think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</p><p>I played a lot of tennis other than that, too. Occasionally pick up
with friends, and weekend tournaments. I did various cross-training
programs over the years in middle school and high school.</p><p>And in the summers I played almost every day and did intense cardio
and sprints as part of the training.</p><p>I never had a lot of fat on my body as a result. And I liked
that. Being strong and fit is a massive life hack, in my opinion. At
least my experience of being healthy most of my life is that it
physically feels great, and I can only really imagine what it&rsquo;s like
to not be that way.</p><p>In college I mostly stopped playing tennis. I didn&rsquo;t make any varsity
teams and club tennis I couldn&rsquo;t make myself go to that often maybe
3-4 times per month. And it wasn&rsquo;t great exercise because we had only
a couple courts and there were a lot of people so we mostly did games.</p><p>I went to the gym sporadically throughout college, mostly when I
caught a look of myself in the mirror and decided I didn&rsquo;t like the
chub I was developing in my belly. But I had basically zero discipline
for anything in college except drinking shitty beer on the weekends,
so the gym energy never lasted long.</p><p>But remarkably, especially because of the diet I kept during college,
I managed to mostly keep my shape. My belly only ever grew to a
certain point that was mostly not noticeable. I still looked fit.</p><p>I&rsquo;m almost 27 now, and I think my good luck is over. I haven&rsquo;t been
working out consistently since graduating college, and I&rsquo;ve gone
through stretches of not eating very well. Especially over the past
six months, I&rsquo;ve been eating a lot of takeout and started to see my
belly grow to previously unseen levels.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that bad, as far as the impact on my emotions or sense of
identity or anything. It&rsquo;s more like, &ldquo;wow, I really like being fit
and I don&rsquo;t like this new development. I should probably do something
about it.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a really good motivator to start working out
consistently again. To introduce some discipline into my life. Wow,
somehow everything I write about comes back to the same few
themes. That&rsquo;s probably a known phenomenon in journalling. Anyway.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about discipline, and hopefully somewhat stay on topic.</p><p>I shunned discipline consciously starting when I entered college. I
had developed a love for programming and saw myself as a typical
hacker type who was lazy but smart and productive nonetheless, because
writing code was fun. I think this attitude got me pretty far and is
the main factor in why I was actually decent at programming when I
graduated. Unlike anyone who graduated with me and had just followed
the curriculum the whole time. Sorry, I digress. I just like to take
pot shots at traditional education.</p><p>The point is I purposefully had no discipline because I thought it was
counterproductive to innovation and happiness. Like I said that was
fine for a few years because I was not living in the real world.</p><p>That even served me alright for a couple years after college, since I
was mature enough to keep my life in order and hold down a good job.</p><p>But now there are things that I can&rsquo;t do without discipline. Staying
fit and healthy is one of them. I don&rsquo;t want to not like how I
look. But I know that I&rsquo;ll grow fat if I don&rsquo;t change something. And
that change won&rsquo;t happen on its own. I won&rsquo;t just all of a sudden
develop a burning love for working out. I won&rsquo;t consistently find time
for it if I don&rsquo;t accept that it&rsquo;s a hard thing to do. In short, it
won&rsquo;t happen if I&rsquo;m not disciplined about it.</p><p>And the thing is, I&rsquo;m finding I love the idea of introducing more
discipline into my life. I think I got a lot out of the period of my
life where I was decidedly undisciplined. It gave me time to explore
the world of programming, the web, startups, various social scenes. I
learned a skill that puts food on the table and a roof over my
head. It gave me a foundation that I can use as a platform for the
next stage.</p><p>That next stage is stuff that requires discipline. Stuff like getting
in shape and staying in shape. Stuff like getting good at writing and
producing a lot of written words to put online.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t really think that I would get to a stage like this. Like,
when I was purposefully shunning discipline, I thought that was a
perfectly good life philosophy that would serve me well for
decades. Only in the last year have I realized that to do the next set
of hard things that I want to accomplish do I need to shift my
thinking on how hard things get done. Sometimes you have to do things
you don&rsquo;t want. Even if you&rsquo;re tired and sore, you roll out of bed and
get to that work out because you have a goal of hitting X workouts in
Y days.</p><p>I have a much greater respect for producing a voluminous amount of
work because I realize that volume is what shapes taste and builds the
muscle memory and frees up the mind and body to eventually put out
quality that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without mountains of crap.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/tags/health>#health</a>
