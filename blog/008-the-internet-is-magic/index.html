to write a word vomit. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s stuff inside my head that'
making me tired? I don&rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just
get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&rsquo;ll be more with
it. I&rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.</p><p>Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for
lunch. Carb sleeps. I have carb sleeps. Been eating too much carbs
recently. Lots of pizza, lots of bread, not enough veggies and
protein.</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing this experiment where I&rsquo;m trying to write a word vomit
without a topic. Or rather, I&rsquo;m starting a word vomit without a topic,
it&rsquo;s just called &ldquo;Untitled&rdquo; right now. But my hypothesis is that a
topic will arise and the post will end up being about that.</p><p>The internet is magic. I feel like that&rsquo;s an obvious thing to say. Ok
what do I mean by obvious. Like, the internet is so widespread in its
effects that if you said that to someone they&rsquo;d be like&mldr; ok, cool, I
know.</p><p>But actually I think there is a vocal majority who don&rsquo;t think the
internet is magic. There is a contentious battle going on right now
between establishment media and tech. Establishment media like the NYT
don&rsquo;t think regular people should be able to post freely
online. People shouldn&rsquo;t be having &ldquo;unfettered conversations&rdquo; lol.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that, though, is it. They don&rsquo;t think people shouldn&rsquo;t be
able to post online because of some fundamental belief about barring
freedom of speech. They don&rsquo;t think people should be able to post
online because it undermines their business model. And actually maybe
more importantly at this point because they&rsquo;d probably still be able
to run the business, it undermines their status model. It&rsquo;s a
massively prestigious position to be widely considered the arbiter of
truth. The people who print what&rsquo;s fit to print, or some such
nonsense.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so much about money. I think it&rsquo;s about
status. That&rsquo;s what people in the elite circles care about,
anyway. They are post money. They aren&rsquo;t thinking about how they&rsquo;re
gonna pay rent, they&rsquo;re thinking about what parties they are going to
get invited to. it&rsquo;s a status thing.</p><p>Ok but I really believe the internet is magic. I brought up that issue
about establishment media not thinking so because I just wanted to
acknowledge it. Idk maybe in hindsight it&rsquo;s not important enough to
acknowledge. Because there is not way the internet doesn&rsquo;t
win. Establishment media is a thing of the past at this point, it just
doesn&rsquo;t know it.</p><p>But ok. For real this time. Why is the internet magic? It brings
opportunity to everyone. Or it enables everyone to access
opportunity. Are those the same things? It allows anyone to change
their situation. It allows people to pursue their dreams and have the
outcome be largely under their control.</p><p>Like Paul Graham says, no one cares you&rsquo;re running lisp on your
server. The full idea there is &ldquo;no one cares if you&rsquo;re running lisp on
your server as long as you&rsquo;re delivering a great project.&rdquo; Well,
people are the new servers. Servers of ideas and generators of
servers. &ldquo;No one cares where you come from as long as you&rsquo;re
delivering great ideas.&rdquo;</p><p>A kid from a small village in Pakistan can accumulate tens of
thousands of followers just by tweeting things people care about. She
doesn&rsquo;t have to associate the account with her real name or
identity. People will follow pseudonymous accounts.</p><p>Why else is the internet magic? It connects people from across
space. It removes the spacial barrier to human connection. Ideology
used to be a geographically concentrated thing. You grew up in a
homogenous community and were indoctrinated to think the same things
as people around you. There was no diversity of ideas in small towns
with little through traffic. There was no chance at idea evolution
because there were few chances at mutations being introduced, and any
mutations that popped up were quickly and violently stamped out.</p><p>But if you grow up online, you are exposed to the marketplace of
ideas. The global (and someday intergalactic) marketplace of
ideas. Ideas from outside your birth community. And the culture of the
internet is to consider ideas on their merits and accept the ones that
win out on merit. At least, that&rsquo;s the culture of the part of the
internet that I come from. There are large and popular and public
parts of the internet that don&rsquo;t practice that culture, but I&rsquo;m
confident the friendly nerd culture from my part of the internet will
spread and eventually win.</p><p>So why is that magic. Ok because people are different. It&rsquo;s not
guaranteed that the community you are born into is the one that is
right for you. It&rsquo;s extremely uncomfortable and miserable and
oppressive to be forced to live in a culture of ideas that you don&rsquo;t
agree with and don&rsquo;t want to participate in. And it&rsquo;s sad. The best
thing about humanity is its potential to grow and realize its
ambition. That applies to humanity as a whole but applies equally well
to a single person. A single soul. The best thing about a human being
is in the right environment it can experience such highs of happiness
and fulfillment. And the internet is the conduit that allows people to
find environments where they will be able to do that.</p><p>I used to think I was a citizen of the internet. I spent a lot of time
online and was learning to code. But I wasn&rsquo;t a citizen of the
internet. Citizenship requires participation. Citizenship requires
contribution. Internet citizenship means contributing to the
marketplace of ideas, not just consuming from it. I&rsquo;m just starting to
feel comfortable considering myself a citizen of the internet, and
maybe it&rsquo;s the thing that makes me happiest about life right now. I
feel like I&rsquo;m just growing up. Or maybe that doesn&rsquo;t exactly describe
it. More like coming out of a cocoon. Testing my wings and taking
flight on an adventure.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=/tags/ambition>#ambition</a>
