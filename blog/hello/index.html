It was hard because you had to do everything yourself, and doing a lot of those things was expensive. Over the past 25 years, since the birth of what we would call the first modern software companies &ndash; Google, Yahoo, Viaweb &ndash; the trend has been that starting a software company involves doing fewer things yourself, and the things that you end up having to do cost less money.</p><p>We are at a point in 2021 where you can start a software company and launch a product entirely from your couch in around two days for around $500. And that $500 is literally just for incorporating the company as a legal entity. The product you can build and host for free. And you don&rsquo;t even need to pay that $500 if you want to run your business as a sole proprietorship, which is just a fancy term for a one-person business that doesn&rsquo;t have a legal entity.</p><p>We are also at a point in 2021 where software companies are making money hand over fist at crazy high margins. People who own equity in successful software companies are getting massively rich every day.</p><p>But unless you live in a small number of locations and run in certain circles, you probably don&rsquo;t know very many people who have started their own software company. Why is that? It&rsquo;s a low-risk strategy for becoming very rich, so what gives?</p><p>One reason is of course lots of people just don&rsquo;t want to. Starting and running a business requires a lot of initiative and time commitment, and comes with a lot of responsibility. You have to deal with customers when people start using your product. You have to make sure your software stays online. All that. Some people just don&rsquo;t want that headache, even if it might result in them getting rich. They like the stability, predictability, and narrow responsibilities of whatever job they currently have. That&rsquo;s cool.</p><p>But my guess is there are millions of people that don&rsquo;t start software businesses simply because they don&rsquo;t know how. And even if they have heard some things about what to do from talks and blogs, they don&rsquo;t have the kind of playbook that would put them over the edge to believing they could really do it.</p><p>And I have another guess, hypothesis really, which is that a playbook exists and just hasn&rsquo;t been put together and widely distributed yet.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=/tags/one>#one</a>
