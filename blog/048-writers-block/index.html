<h1 class=post-title>048 - Writers Block</h1>
<time>December 31, 2021</time>
<div>
<p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I have writer&rsquo;s block so much as I don&rsquo;t know how to
write what I want to write. That&rsquo;s not what I think of as writer&rsquo;s
block, anyway. What writer&rsquo;s block is to me is the inability write,
period.</p>
<p>Which is not what I have because I&rsquo;ve actually been writing a fair
amount all the way through this whole thing of not being able to
write.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to the thing Sasha Chapin wrote about &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s
block&rdquo; which is that if you have writer&rsquo;s block then it&rsquo;s because you
are embarrassed about what you think about, or something like that.</p>
<p>He says because obviously you have thoughts in your head, you could
write them down and then you would be writing something. But if you
don&rsquo;t want to do that then it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t think the things in
your head are worth writing down, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I think the things in my head, at least at the surface level, are not
interesting to write down. Hmm, but why do I think that?</p>
<p>One thought is because I&rsquo;ve written about it lots before. The ideas
about starting a solo software company, making enough money to quit my
job, how to start a solo software company, etc.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I have anything more to say about that stuff, other
than what I&rsquo;ve already said.</p>
<p>But I wonder if I do.</p>
<p>Have something more to say about that stuff.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give it a shot.</p>
<p>Ok, one thing I&rsquo;ve been thinking more seriously about related to my
journey of starting a successful software company is that there is a
lot of other stuff you have to keep up with while you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Building a successful company is something that happens over the
course of years, not weeks or months, and so you can&rsquo;t neglect life
while you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, sure I guess you can, but it drastically lowers your chance of
success if you aren&rsquo;t eating well, exercising, seeing friends,
showering, etc.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve only been OK at keeping up with all of these things so far in
my own journey. I know I need to get better, and that&rsquo;s one of the
things I&rsquo;m excited to do in 2022. I&rsquo;m going to put the final pieces
into place as far as rounding out my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start eating well: takeout/restaurant at most like once
or twice per month. I&rsquo;m going to start working out: lifting 3-4 times
per week. And I&rsquo;m going to keep up a good sleep schedule through all
of this: something like 10pm to 6am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to read a lot, which I know I can do if I just do 20-30
minutes before bed every day. It&rsquo;s one of those things where the time
you spend every day doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot but if you do it every day
instead of just never doing it, then it adds up way faster than you
realize.</p>
<p>The image I have in my head of myself when I&rsquo;m able to do all these
things is just like a fucking super human. Like, on the one hand I
know it&rsquo;s possible, and I&rsquo;m confident I can do it. And on the other
hand it&rsquo;s like holy shit I would literally be the best version of
myself if all of these things came together.</p>
<p>Would I have a chance to write every day? It&rsquo;s definitely possible. If
I wake up at 6am and go to the gym and am back by like 7am, then clean
the kitchen until 8am, then shower and make coffee, I can probably
start writing at like 8:45am, bang out a blog post, and start work by
10am. Which is a fine schedule.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that&rsquo;s what I have more to say about the whole
starting a solo saas company journey thing. I have most of the pieces
together, I just need to round out my life in a couple key areas and
then it&rsquo;s just straight execution and maintenance of that schedule.</p>
<p>Of course, it can&rsquo;t be so rigid. There has to be slack. Weekends might
have to be unscheduled. Vacation will be taken. I won&rsquo;t build myself
into a schedule that drives me mad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;m capable of doing that. My personality is such
that I&rsquo;m usually, if not always, incapable of staying in situations
that I don&rsquo;t like. So the trick will be following the schedule, not
worrying that I&rsquo;m killing myself.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m excited to get started on this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel good about the shape I&rsquo;m in; I eat way too much takeout
and don&rsquo;t exercise. But I knew that it might take until the end of
this year to get to a point where I could start doing that again. A
couple big disruptions this year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also excited to start making moves for Canopy Charts. I feel
really good about the feedback I&rsquo;ve gotten so far, and I even have one
potential customer who is ready to start paying for the service once I
had a couple features.</p>
<p>I feel good about the likely outcome once I start putting a lot of
time and energy into outreach. Might actually start making some money
online next year.</p>
<p>But right now I&rsquo;m on vacation, and so I&rsquo;m not pushing myself to get
started with any of those efforts yet. I think about doing them every
day, and I know I could get started with any or all of them. But I
think it&rsquo;s important to take time off. Like, actually off, where I
read and watch tv and eat yummy food and write and work on something
random and short term just for fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a good job of that this vacation. I&rsquo;m writing a bunch, I&rsquo;ve
seen friends and family, I&rsquo;m watching some good tv, I&rsquo;m eating lots of
good food (maybe a little too much, though, since right now I feel
pretty bloated).</p>
<p>The future looks bright.</p>
