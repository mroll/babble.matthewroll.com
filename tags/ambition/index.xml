It rings true to my experience. Basically it says that even people with killer taste cannot produce up to their own standards when they are just starting out. They have a vision for something great, and they try to build it, but it turns out inevitably to look like shit.
This can be discouraging, but fear not, goes the quote.</description></item><item><title>037 - Maybe I Should Just Get Started</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/037-maybe-i-should-just-get-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 18:48:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/037-maybe-i-should-just-get-started/</guid><description>I have this idea that I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually start some big project that will be really technically interesting and challenging, and I&amp;rsquo;ll work on it for years and it will pay my bills and maybe even make me rich.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</description></item><item><title>011 - Living in the Moment</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 08:56:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m that good at living in the moment. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m not that good at it. I&amp;rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&amp;rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</description></item><item><title>008 - The Internet Is Magic</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/008-the-internet-is-magic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 16:11:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/008-the-internet-is-magic/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 3:49pm on a Friday and I&amp;rsquo;m so tired but I feel like I just want to write a word vomit. It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&amp;rsquo;ll be more with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</description></item><item><title>005 - Making Friends</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 21:09:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had friends, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never put much effort into making friends. Ah, ok, that&amp;rsquo;s already not true. In eighth grade I decided for some deranged reason that only makes sense in the mind of a teenager that I wanted to be popular. And so I started putting a lot of effort into becoming friends with the popular kids. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure at this point how I bootstrapped that endeavor.</description></item></channel></rss>
