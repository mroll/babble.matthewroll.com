It rings true to my experience. Basically it says that even people with killer taste cannot produce up to their own standards when they are just starting out. They have a vision for something great, and they try to build it, but it turns out inevitably to look like shit.
This can be discouraging, but fear not, goes the quote.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 17, 2021</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/037-maybe-i-should-just-get-started/>037 - Maybe I Should Just Get Started</a></h2><div><p>I have this idea that I&rsquo;ll eventually start some big project that will be really technically interesting and challenging, and I&rsquo;ll work on it for years and it will pay my bills and maybe even make me rich.
I&rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 8, 2021</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/>011 - Living in the Moment</a></h2><div><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that good at living in the moment. I&rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not that good at it. I&rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 8, 2021</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/008-the-internet-is-magic/>008 - The Internet Is Magic</a></h2><div><p>It&rsquo;s 3:49pm on a Friday and I&rsquo;m so tired but I feel like I just want to write a word vomit. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&rsquo;ll be more with it. I&rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 2, 2021</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/>005 - Making Friends</a></h2><div><p>I&rsquo;ve always had friends, but I&rsquo;ve never put much effort into making friends. Ah, ok, that&rsquo;s already not true. In eighth grade I decided for some deranged reason that only makes sense in the mind of a teenager that I wanted to be popular. And so I started putting a lot of effort into becoming friends with the popular kids. I&rsquo;m not even sure at this point how I bootstrapped that endeavor.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 29, 2021</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=https://babble.matthewroll.com/js/main.min.c1aee25a817e9beb1f9c4afd9d62311227a7f5e46720e404dc1dda97281f47f2.js integrity="sha256-wa7iWoF+m+sfnEr9nWIxEien9eRnIOQE3B3alygfR/I=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
