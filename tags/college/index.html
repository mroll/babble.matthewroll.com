I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &ldquo;free will&rdquo; or &ldquo;rational agency&rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 10, 2021</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/>011 - Living in the Moment</a></h2><div><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that good at living in the moment. I&rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not that good at it. I&rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 8, 2021</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/>010 - Body Image</a></h2><div><p>Body image is something I haven&rsquo;t really had to think serious about before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 6, 2021</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=https://babble.matthewroll.com/js/main.min.c1aee25a817e9beb1f9c4afd9d62311227a7f5e46720e404dc1dda97281f47f2.js integrity="sha256-wa7iWoF+m+sfnEr9nWIxEien9eRnIOQE3B3alygfR/I=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
