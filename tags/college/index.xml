I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m not that good at it. I&amp;rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&amp;rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</description></item><item><title>010 - Body Image</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:14:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/</guid><description>Body image is something I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had to think serious about before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</description></item></channel></rss>
