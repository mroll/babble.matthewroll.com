I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</description></item></channel></rss>
