What is &amp;ldquo;activation energy&amp;rdquo; in this context? It&amp;rsquo;s the energy you need to muster to start doing some task. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s a work thing, like sitting down to work in the morning, or doing a chore like washing the dishes, or doing your taxes, or working out.</description></item><item><title>009 - Food Management</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/009-food-management/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 13:28:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/009-food-management/</guid><description>Food is one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s just in the background of life. For me, at least. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&amp;rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</description></item><item><title>006 - Hobbies</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/006-hobbies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:00:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/006-hobbies/</guid><description>I definitely like the idea of hobbies. Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
