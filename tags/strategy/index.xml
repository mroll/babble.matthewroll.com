It&amp;rsquo;s not super detailed and doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything in life, and actually now that I think about it it&amp;rsquo;s actually mostly just about making money. But since what I do to make money and how much money I make has a massive impact on how I live my life and what options are open for living my life, I kind of think of it as a general life plan.</description></item><item><title>037 - Maybe I Should Just Get Started</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/037-maybe-i-should-just-get-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 18:48:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/037-maybe-i-should-just-get-started/</guid><description>I have this idea that I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually start some big project that will be really technically interesting and challenging, and I&amp;rsquo;ll work on it for years and it will pay my bills and maybe even make me rich.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</description></item><item><title>027 - Trusting the Process</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/027-trusting-the-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 10:44:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/027-trusting-the-process/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a really big fan of trusting the process. It&amp;rsquo;s a phrase I invoke when someone is not sure that we&amp;rsquo;re doing the right thing because results haven&amp;rsquo;t materialized yet. And the idea behind trusting the process is that the process make sense from first principles. The results will come because we can predict from first principles that this process will generate those results.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good mental model for doing things that take a long time.</description></item><item><title>022 - Strategy, Goals, and Tactics</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/022-strategy-goals-and-tactics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 19:47:13 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/022-strategy-goals-and-tactics/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m in a sort of quiet period in my life where I&amp;rsquo;m not building anything. At least in the way I&amp;rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&amp;rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&amp;rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&amp;rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</description></item></channel></rss>
