It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&amp;rsquo;ll be more with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</description></item><item><title>004 - Crypto</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/004-crypto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 15:05:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/004-crypto/</guid><description>When I got to college in 2012 I had already read Cryptonomicon and it was my favorite book. At some point that year I also found out about bitcoin, which was obviously like the ideas in Cryptonomicon manifest in the real world. Real world digital gold. I thought it was really cool, and I tried to download the software and start mining bitcoin from my laptop in my freshman dorm room.</description></item><item><title>002 - Education</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/002-education/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 22:02:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/002-education/</guid><description>I want to write about education because I think I bundle too many ideas into that word, and I want to tease them apart. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any coherent positions on &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; mostly because it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any crisp meaning in my head.
Ok, what are the concepts that I associate with the word &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;?
First is the school system in the United States. I get a sort of visual of lots of different school units spread over a large geography when I think of the term &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s how my mind manifests the idea of the United States primary school system.</description></item></channel></rss>
