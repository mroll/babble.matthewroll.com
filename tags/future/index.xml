It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&amp;rsquo;ll be more with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</description></item><item><title>006 - Hobbies</title><link>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/blog/006-hobbies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:00:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mroll.github.io/babble.matthewroll.com/blog/006-hobbies/</guid><description>I definitely like the idea of hobbies. Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
