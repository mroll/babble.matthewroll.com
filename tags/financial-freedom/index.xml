It&amp;rsquo;s a phrase I invoke when someone is not sure that we&amp;rsquo;re doing the right thing because results haven&amp;rsquo;t materialized yet. And the idea behind trusting the process is that the process make sense from first principles. The results will come because we can predict from first principles that this process will generate those results.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good mental model for doing things that take a long time.</description></item><item><title>002 - Education</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/002-education/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 22:02:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/002-education/</guid><description>I want to write about education because I think I bundle too many ideas into that word, and I want to tease them apart. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any coherent positions on &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; mostly because it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any crisp meaning in my head.
Ok, what are the concepts that I associate with the word &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;?
First is the school system in the United States. I get a sort of visual of lots of different school units spread over a large geography when I think of the term &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s how my mind manifests the idea of the United States primary school system.</description></item></channel></rss>
