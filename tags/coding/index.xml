I&amp;rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</description></item><item><title>012 - Changing Yourself If It Makes Sense</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 09:26:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</guid><description>When I was a kid I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had much sense of identity. I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;rational agency&amp;rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</description></item></channel></rss>
