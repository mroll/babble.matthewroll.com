039 - Getting Good at Programming
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I will just say off the bat that I am a little bit nervous to write this one and I don&rsquo;t really know what I am going to say. Because getting good at programming is something I feel in my bones, rather than something that I know how to articulate to people.
What does getting good at programming feel like? I mean I guess it feels like being able to write code for an hour without running it and be confident that you are going in the right direction.</p>

037 - Maybe I Should Just Get Started
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I have this idea that I&rsquo;ll eventually start some big project that will be really technically interesting and challenging, and I&rsquo;ll work on it for years and it will pay my bills and maybe even make me rich.
I&rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</p>

012 - Changing Yourself If It Makes Sense
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>When I was a kid I don&rsquo;t think I had much sense of identity. I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &ldquo;free will&rdquo; or &ldquo;rational agency&rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</p>
