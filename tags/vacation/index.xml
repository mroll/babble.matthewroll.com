Maybe less, but it feels like a long time. I was doing them really consistently for more than a month so going more than like 2-3 days feels like ages.
Which is good, because it means I&amp;rsquo;m noticing the lack of them in my routine and it&amp;rsquo;s making me want to come back to writing them. I think that&amp;rsquo;s the sign of a habit that will stick around for a while.</description></item><item><title>025 - Random I</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/025-random-i/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 21:20:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/025-random-i/</guid><description>This word vomit has no topic because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing obvious on my mind that I want to write about, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t written one in days and so I feel the need to get back to it.
I&amp;rsquo;m kind of settling into my &amp;ldquo;explore&amp;rdquo; phase. I wrote about this a few entries back, but basically I want to spend some time looking for the next fulfilling thing to do with my life.</description></item></channel></rss>
