It was highly interesting for a small number of reasons (as opposed to highly interesting for a large number of somewhat interesting reasons).
He lives a principled life in a way that is uncommon in today&amp;rsquo;s world.
He believes in God in a way you don&amp;rsquo;t see in today&amp;rsquo;s world, at least outside of weird Evangelical communities.
I think the principled thing is the one that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me and what I want to write a post about.</description></item><item><title>034 - Identity as a Writer</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/034-identity-as-a-writer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 21:14:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/034-identity-as-a-writer/</guid><description>What makes someone &amp;ldquo;a writer.&amp;rdquo; Like, being &amp;ldquo;a writer&amp;rdquo; is an occupation, certainly. If you have been paid for something you wrote then you can consider yourself a writer. Actually as I write that I realize that I have been paid for something I wrote: $100 BTC for a blog post reviewing Balaji Srinivasan&amp;rsquo;s post on network states.
If you get paid to write a book, or if you are regularly paid to write articles for a website, you are a writer.</description></item></channel></rss>
