For me, at least. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&amp;rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</description></item></channel></rss>
