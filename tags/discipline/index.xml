That&amp;rsquo;s not what I think of as writer&amp;rsquo;s block, anyway. What writer&amp;rsquo;s block is to me is the inability write, period.
Which is not what I have because I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been writing a fair amount all the way through this whole thing of not being able to write.
I keep coming back to the thing Sasha Chapin wrote about &amp;ldquo;writer&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo; which is that if you have writer&amp;rsquo;s block then it&amp;rsquo;s because you are embarrassed about what you think about, or something like that.</description></item><item><title>010 - Body Image</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:14:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/010-body-image/</guid><description>Body image is something I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had to think serious about before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</description></item></channel></rss>
