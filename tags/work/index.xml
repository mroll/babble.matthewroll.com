There are a lot of things I see around work that can be improved. And that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be that hard to improve them. Just some focused and careful thought to research and design solutions, and then some straightforward implementation.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about like code review tools, static analysis, performance improvements in different areas of the data pipeline, development process improvements like automated deploys and faster builds, etc etc etc.</description></item><item><title>011 - Living in the Moment</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 08:56:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/011-living-in-the-moment/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m that good at living in the moment. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m not that good at it. I&amp;rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&amp;rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
