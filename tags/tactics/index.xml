I want that brain. I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have that brain, but this project is me putting time and energy directly toward a future where that is the brain I have. I just think there is so much interesting stuff that gets lost because only so much can fit inside your head and so you eventually forget and move onto other interesting things without properly documenting what you were thinking about previously.</description></item><item><title>031 - Gamification</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/031-gamification/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 20:47:49 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/031-gamification/</guid><description>You know every time I go to write one of these word vomits I get a little bit nervous.

At least in the way I&amp;rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&amp;rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&amp;rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&amp;rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</description></item></channel></rss>
