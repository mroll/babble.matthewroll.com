I was kind of thinking to myself over the past few days &amp;ldquo;when are you supposed to see results?&amp;rdquo; about this writing thing. This word vomit thing. Visa says it helped him work out a bunch of personal issues like self-confidence and self-love. Basically when I got like the tenth one, I started wondering how it would happen.</description></item><item><title>015 - Need to Learn How to Play</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/015-need-to-learn-how-to-play/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 15:56:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/015-need-to-learn-how-to-play/</guid><description>I feel like the central tension in my life is not feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m working towards the right thing. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the right thing is, and maybe I am doing things that are bringing me closer to it, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always feel like it.
Maybe it felt like it when I won the $100 BTC from the most recent 1729 task. Because one thing I want to be good at is writing on the internet, and winning money by writing good things on the internet seems like nice validation of that goal.</description></item><item><title>014 - Activation Energy</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/014-activation-energy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 18:27:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/014-activation-energy/</guid><description>There is this concept of activation energy that seems super important to me, and activation energy actually describes it pretty well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see people talking about it very much (if at all, can&amp;rsquo;t recall any examples), and definitely don&amp;rsquo;t see people using this metaphor.
What is &amp;ldquo;activation energy&amp;rdquo; in this context? It&amp;rsquo;s the energy you need to muster to start doing some task. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s a work thing, like sitting down to work in the morning, or doing a chore like washing the dishes, or doing your taxes, or working out.</description></item><item><title>012 - Changing Yourself If It Makes Sense</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 09:26:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</guid><description>When I was a kid I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had much sense of identity. I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;rational agency&amp;rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</description></item></channel></rss>
