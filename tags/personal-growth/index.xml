What is &amp;ldquo;activation energy&amp;rdquo; in this context? It&amp;rsquo;s the energy you need to muster to start doing some task.

I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;rational agency&amp;rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</description></item></channel></rss>
