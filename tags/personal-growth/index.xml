That&amp;rsquo;s not what I think of as writer&amp;rsquo;s block, anyway. What writer&amp;rsquo;s block is to me is the inability write, period.
Which is not what I have because I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been writing a fair amount all the way through this whole thing of not being able to write.
I keep coming back to the thing Sasha Chapin wrote about &amp;ldquo;writer&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo; which is that if you have writer&amp;rsquo;s block then it&amp;rsquo;s because you are embarrassed about what you think about, or something like that.</description></item><item><title>046 - The Purpose of a Modern Junto</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/046-the-purpose-of-a-modern-junto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 16:48:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/046-the-purpose-of-a-modern-junto/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;m reading Ben Franklin&amp;rsquo;s Autobiography, and it&amp;rsquo;s really good. It honestly reads like a novel. His early life was quite adventurous and he traveled widely, became acquainted with people in high places, and set out on his own in business.
I really admire his intelligence and the way he plays the game of life.
One thing he does upon making it back to Philadelphia after his year long stay in London is start a social/intellectual club called the Junto.</description></item><item><title>040 - Moving on From California</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/040-moving-on-from-california/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 22:40:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/040-moving-on-from-california/</guid><description>Today is my last day in California. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the SFO airport waiting for my flight back east to board. Figured it was a good time to write a word vomit. Maybe process some stuff that I&amp;rsquo;m feeling.
The thing is I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling anything significant. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to go back east, back home, is really how I think about it. I never got to feel like Cali was home.</description></item><item><title>039 - Getting Good at Programming</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/039-getting-good-at-programming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 02:10:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/039-getting-good-at-programming/</guid><description>I will just say off the bat that I am a little bit nervous to write this one and I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I am going to say. Because getting good at programming is something I feel in my bones, rather than something that I know how to articulate to people.
What does getting good at programming feel like? I mean I guess it feels like being able to write code for an hour without running it and be confident that you are going in the right direction.</description></item><item><title>038 - On Taste</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/038-on-taste/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 21:53:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/038-on-taste/</guid><description>There is a great Ira Glass quote about taste and how you build it. It rings true to my experience. Basically it says that even people with killer taste cannot produce up to their own standards when they are just starting out. They have a vision for something great, and they try to build it, but it turns out inevitably to look like shit.
This can be discouraging, but fear not, goes the quote.</description></item><item><title>036 - The Writing Brain I'm Trying to Build</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/036-the-writing-brain-im-trying-to-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 20:49:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/036-the-writing-brain-im-trying-to-build/</guid><description>There is a type of brain that can just push words out onto the page at an alarming rate with relative ease. I want that brain. I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have that brain, but this project is me putting time and energy directly toward a future where that is the brain I have. I just think there is so much interesting stuff that gets lost because only so much can fit inside your head and so you eventually forget and move onto other interesting things without properly documenting what you were thinking about previously.</description></item><item><title>033 - Moving</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/033-moving/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 11:13:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/033-moving/</guid><description>We just decided, yesterday, to move to New York City a month earlier than we had originally planned. Actually maybe two months earlier? Anyway, the point is we are starting the process right now, like today. We are selling most of our stuff, packing up the rest, and leaving California at the end of June. We are not coming back. Our apartment will be leased until the end of September, but we just want to get out and get to the city as soon as possible.</description></item><item><title>032 - Figuring Out Life</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/032-figuring-out-life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 23:25:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/032-figuring-out-life/</guid><description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a cultural meme where I come from that it takes a long time to figure out life. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a cultural meme everywhere, and certainly not for all of time. Like there are cultures, and there have been times, where for the majority if not all people, what they will do in life is pretty much set from the time they are born.
Is figuring out life a relatively new concept?</description></item><item><title>029 - When Things Actually Work Out</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/029-when-things-actually-work-out/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 16:04:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/029-when-things-actually-work-out/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a strange feeling &amp;ndash; an amazing feeling, to be sure &amp;ndash; when something that a few months ago you wished you had you suddenly have. My experience with this is not universal, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s probably in the majority. In my life, several things that I&amp;rsquo;ve really wanted to happen have happened, but probably more have not happened.
I did not go to a D1 college to play tennis.</description></item><item><title>026 - Reflections on 1-25</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/026-reflections-on-1-25/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 18:00:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/026-reflections-on-1-25/</guid><description>This is my 26th word vomit, which means I&amp;rsquo;ve done 25 already. I thought it would be good to do a reflection on what it&amp;rsquo;s been like so far.
For starters, I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I&amp;rsquo;m still doing it! I start lots of projects and I also quit lots of projects before they become anything significant. I know it&amp;rsquo;s all relative, but writing 25,000 words of stream of consciousness journalling over the course of about a month is significant to me.</description></item><item><title>022 - Strategy, Goals, and Tactics</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/022-strategy-goals-and-tactics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 19:47:13 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/022-strategy-goals-and-tactics/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m in a sort of quiet period in my life where I&amp;rsquo;m not building anything. At least in the way I&amp;rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&amp;rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&amp;rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&amp;rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</description></item><item><title>021 - It's Not Enough to Understand Infinite Games</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/021-its-not-enough-to-understand-infinite-games/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 12:49:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/021-its-not-enough-to-understand-infinite-games/</guid><description>Once you understand the concept of an infinite game, it&amp;rsquo;s not like you can just start playing one because you like the idea of it. You need to have a game to play. You need to have something that you like doing and that can fit the model of an infinite game.
Because the core part of being an infinite game player is that you enjoy the game so much that you just want to keep playing it.</description></item><item><title>019 - Infinite Games</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/019-infinite-games/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:07:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/019-infinite-games/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned infinite games a few times before in word vomits, but I realize I haven&amp;rsquo;t dedicated a whole one to that concept yet. It&amp;rsquo;s about time, I&amp;rsquo;d say. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the ideas that I&amp;rsquo;m working my way around and through in mind my recently, because I think really understanding it will do a lot for my happiness and sense of fulfillment in life.
It will also probably help me figure out what to work on.</description></item><item><title>018 - Slack as Necessary Ingredient</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/018-slack-as-necessary-ingredient/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 22:18:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/018-slack-as-necessary-ingredient/</guid><description>This week at work is a return to the idea that slack is a necessary ingredient for outsized success. There are a lot of things I see around work that can be improved. And that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be that hard to improve them. Just some focused and careful thought to research and design solutions, and then some straightforward implementation.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about like code review tools, static analysis, performance improvements in different areas of the data pipeline, development process improvements like automated deploys and faster builds, etc etc etc.</description></item><item><title>016 - Exploring Playfulness</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/016-exploring-playfulness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 13:55:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/016-exploring-playfulness/</guid><description>I was not expecting to make any sort of breakthrough when I was writing yesterday. I was kind of thinking to myself over the past few days &amp;ldquo;when are you supposed to see results?&amp;rdquo; about this writing thing. This word vomit thing. Visa says it helped him work out a bunch of personal issues like self-confidence and self-love. Basically when I got like the tenth one, I started wondering how it would happen.</description></item><item><title>015 - Need to Learn How to Play</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/015-need-to-learn-how-to-play/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 15:56:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/015-need-to-learn-how-to-play/</guid><description>I feel like the central tension in my life is not feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m working towards the right thing. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the right thing is, and maybe I am doing things that are bringing me closer to it, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always feel like it.
Maybe it felt like it when I won the $100 BTC from the most recent 1729 task. Because one thing I want to be good at is writing on the internet, and winning money by writing good things on the internet seems like nice validation of that goal.</description></item><item><title>014 - Activation Energy</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/014-activation-energy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 18:27:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/014-activation-energy/</guid><description>There is this concept of activation energy that seems super important to me, and activation energy actually describes it pretty well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see people talking about it very much (if at all, can&amp;rsquo;t recall any examples), and definitely don&amp;rsquo;t see people using this metaphor.
What is &amp;ldquo;activation energy&amp;rdquo; in this context? It&amp;rsquo;s the energy you need to muster to start doing some task. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s a work thing, like sitting down to work in the morning, or doing a chore like washing the dishes, or doing your taxes, or working out.</description></item><item><title>012 - Changing Yourself If It Makes Sense</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 09:26:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/012-changing-yourself-if-it-makes-sense/</guid><description>When I was a kid I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had much sense of identity. I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;rational agency&amp;rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</description></item></channel></rss>
