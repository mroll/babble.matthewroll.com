It was highly interesting for a small number of reasons (as opposed to highly interesting for a large number of somewhat interesting reasons).
He lives a principled life in a way that is uncommon in today&amp;rsquo;s world.
He believes in God in a way you don&amp;rsquo;t see in today&amp;rsquo;s world, at least outside of weird Evangelical communities.
I think the principled thing is the one that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me and what I want to write a post about.</description></item><item><title>042 - What I Think About</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/042-what-i-think-about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 14:03:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/042-what-i-think-about/</guid><description>Sasha Chapin says that if you think you have writer&amp;rsquo;s block you actually are just lying to yourself about who you are and what you think about. That if you feel like you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to write about, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong because obviously there are thoughts floating around in your head and you should just look at them and put them down on paper roughly in the order they occur to you.</description></item></channel></rss>
