It honestly reads like a novel. His early life was quite adventurous and he traveled widely, became acquainted with people in high places, and set out on his own in business.
I really admire his intelligence and the way he plays the game of life.
One thing he does upon making it back to Philadelphia after his year long stay in London is start a social/intellectual club called the Junto.</description></item><item><title>045 - Hosting Stuff</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/045-hosting-stuff/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 11:41:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/045-hosting-stuff/</guid><description>Hosting people at my apartment is something I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently discovered I really enjoy. It might have something to do with the fact that only now do I have an apartment that is big enough to properly have people over. We have a dedicated living room, not just a corner of the studio where the couch is. And we have a bar area where we can prepare drinks, and we have a pretty big open floor in the middle of the apartment where we can put out a table and chairs to seat eight people.</description></item></channel></rss>
