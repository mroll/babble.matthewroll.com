It might have something to do with the fact that only now do I have an apartment that is big enough to properly have people over. We have a dedicated living room, not just a corner of the studio where the couch is. And we have a bar area where we can prepare drinks, and we have a pretty big open floor in the middle of the apartment where we can put out a table and chairs to seat eight people.</description></item></channel></rss>
