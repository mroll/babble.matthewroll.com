That&amp;rsquo;s not what I think of as writer&amp;rsquo;s block, anyway. What writer&amp;rsquo;s block is to me is the inability write, period.
Which is not what I have because I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been writing a fair amount all the way through this whole thing of not being able to write.
I keep coming back to the thing Sasha Chapin wrote about &amp;ldquo;writer&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo; which is that if you have writer&amp;rsquo;s block then it&amp;rsquo;s because you are embarrassed about what you think about, or something like that.</description></item><item><title>009 - Food Management</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/009-food-management/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 13:28:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/009-food-management/</guid><description>Food is one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s just in the background of life. For me, at least. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&amp;rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</description></item></channel></rss>
