043 - Something of a Life Plan
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;ve thought a fair amount about over the past few years but haven&rsquo;t put into writing as far as I can remember is my high level, general life plan for the next ten years.
It&rsquo;s not super detailed and doesn&rsquo;t cover everything in life, and actually now that I think about it it&rsquo;s actually mostly just about making money. But since what I do to make money and how much money I make has a massive impact on how I live my life and what options are open for living my life, I kind of think of it as a general life plan.</p>

038 - On Taste
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is a great Ira Glass quote about taste and how you build it. It rings true to my experience. Basically it says that even people with killer taste cannot produce up to their own standards when they are just starting out. They have a vision for something great, and they try to build it, but it turns out inevitably to look like shit.
This can be discouraging, but fear not, goes the quote.</p>

037 - Maybe I Should Just Get Started
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I have this idea that I&rsquo;ll eventually start some big project that will be really technically interesting and challenging, and I&rsquo;ll work on it for years and it will pay my bills and maybe even make me rich.
I&rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</p>

036 - The Writing Brain I'm Trying to Build
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is a type of brain that can just push words out onto the page at an alarming rate with relative ease. I want that brain. I don&rsquo;t currently have that brain, but this project is me putting time and energy directly toward a future where that is the brain I have. I just think there is so much interesting stuff that gets lost because only so much can fit inside your head and so you eventually forget and move onto other interesting things without properly documenting what you were thinking about previously.</p>

031 - Gamification
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>You know every time I go to write one of these word vomits I get a little bit nervous. Like a little bit scared. I think it comes from a fear that I won&rsquo;t have enough to say, or that it will take too much effort or too much time to write a thousands words.
Which is a little weird considering I&rsquo;ve done thirty of these so far and none of them have been that hard.</p>

029 - When Things Actually Work Out
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange feeling &ndash; an amazing feeling, to be sure &ndash; when something that a few months ago you wished you had you suddenly have. My experience with this is not universal, but I feel like it&rsquo;s probably in the majority. In my life, several things that I&rsquo;ve really wanted to happen have happened, but probably more have not happened.
I did not go to a D1 college to play tennis.</p>

027 - Trusting the Process
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I&rsquo;m a really big fan of trusting the process. It&rsquo;s a phrase I invoke when someone is not sure that we&rsquo;re doing the right thing because results haven&rsquo;t materialized yet. And the idea behind trusting the process is that the process make sense from first principles. The results will come because we can predict from first principles that this process will generate those results.
It&rsquo;s a good mental model for doing things that take a long time.</p>

022 - Strategy, Goals, and Tactics
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a sort of quiet period in my life where I&rsquo;m not building anything. At least in the way I&rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</p>
