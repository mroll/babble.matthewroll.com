Or I guess even just someone who has been reading a lot for a while. It makes them different than other people. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the difference is, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s real.

When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &amp;ldquo;birth name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;given name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;state name&amp;rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &amp;ldquo;Matt Roll&amp;rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.</description></item></channel></rss>
