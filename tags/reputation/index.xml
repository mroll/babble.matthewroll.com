When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &amp;ldquo;birth name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;given name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;state name&amp;rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &amp;ldquo;Matt Roll&amp;rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.
