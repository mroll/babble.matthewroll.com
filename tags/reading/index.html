049 - Notes on The Journal of John Woolman
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Just finished The Journal of John Woolman. It was highly interesting for a small number of reasons (as opposed to highly interesting for a large number of somewhat interesting reasons).
He lives a principled life in a way that is uncommon in today&rsquo;s world.
He believes in God in a way you don&rsquo;t see in today&rsquo;s world, at least outside of weird Evangelical communities.
I think the principled thing is the one that&rsquo;s interesting to me and what I want to write a post about.</p>

035 - Writing Fiction
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiction is what got me into reading. As a kid I fell in love with stories written down as words on pages. I think this is a pretty common theme among people who love reading, but something about books is magical. And I saw that magic early on.
At some point, I think maybe it was middle school, I got into science fiction. I don&rsquo;t know what the first science fiction I read was.</p>

028 - Vacation
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like two weeks since I did a word vomit. Maybe less, but it feels like a long time. I was doing them really consistently for more than a month so going more than like 2-3 days feels like ages.
Which is good, because it means I&rsquo;m noticing the lack of them in my routine and it&rsquo;s making me want to come back to writing them. I think that&rsquo;s the sign of a habit that will stick around for a while.</p>

025 - Random I
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>This word vomit has no topic because there&rsquo;s nothing obvious on my mind that I want to write about, but I haven&rsquo;t written one in days and so I feel the need to get back to it.
I&rsquo;m kind of settling into my &ldquo;explore&rdquo; phase. I wrote about this a few entries back, but basically I want to spend some time looking for the next fulfilling thing to do with my life.</p>

023 - What Is It About Reading
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is something about people that grew up reading a lot. Or I guess even just someone who has been reading a lot for a while. It makes them different than other people. I&rsquo;m not sure what the difference is, but I feel like it&rsquo;s real.
Now, reading a lot is relative. I think I used to read a lot, probably hit 40 or 50 books a year at my peak in late middle school, early high school.</p>

006 - Hobbies
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I definitely like the idea of hobbies. Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</p>

005 - Making Friends
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had friends, but I&rsquo;ve never put much effort into making friends. Ah, ok, that&rsquo;s already not true. In eighth grade I decided for some deranged reason that only makes sense in the mind of a teenager that I wanted to be popular. And so I started putting a lot of effort into becoming friends with the popular kids. I&rsquo;m not even sure at this point how I bootstrapped that endeavor.</p>

001 - Why am I writing?
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>This is the first post in a 1,000 post project. A project to write a million words. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if those words are good, mediocre, amazing, or awful. It just matters that they exist. Because if they exist, it means I forced my brain to make a million words come out of my brain, through my fingers and the keyboard, into a computer, and onto the internet. And if that has happened, then I&rsquo;ve probably learned a few things about myself, about writing, about consistency, about practice.</p>
