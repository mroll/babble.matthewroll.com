Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</description></item><item><title>005 - Making Friends</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 21:09:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/005-making-friends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had friends, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never put much effort into making friends.

Because if they exist, it means I forced my brain to make a million words come out of my brain, through my fingers and the keyboard, into a computer, and onto the internet. And if that has happened, then I&amp;rsquo;ve probably learned a few things about myself, about writing, about consistency, about practice.</description></item></channel></rss>
