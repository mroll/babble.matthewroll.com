It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&amp;rsquo;ll be more with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</description></item><item><title>007 - Pseudonymity</title><link>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/007-pseudonymity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 12:01:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://babble.matthewroll.com/blog/007-pseudonymity/</guid><description>Pseudonymity is being known under a name different than your given name. When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &amp;ldquo;birth name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;given name&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;state name&amp;rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &amp;ldquo;Matt Roll&amp;rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.</description></item></channel></rss>
