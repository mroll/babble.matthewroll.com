At least as far as I know you can only live one life. I assume if reincarnation were a thing then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first instance of the my being. My experience is that I have no past lives, and so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to have future lives.
I mean maybe there could be reincarnation if it worked in a way that when you are living a life you don&amp;rsquo;t remember your past lives, and like when you die in one life maybe there is like an intermediate period where you return to your full, complete self in the void and you remember all of the lives that you&amp;rsquo;ve lived until that moment, and then you go into another life.</description></item></channel></rss>
