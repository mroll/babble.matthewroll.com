Like a little bit scared. I think it comes from a fear that I won&rsquo;t have enough to say, or that it will take too much effort or too much time to write a thousands words.
Which is a little weird considering I&rsquo;ve done thirty of these so far and none of them have been that hard.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 23, 2021</time>

At least as far as I know you can only live one life. I assume if reincarnation were a thing then I wouldn&rsquo;t be the first instance of the my being. My experience is that I have no past lives, and so I don&rsquo;t expect to have future lives.
I mean maybe there could be reincarnation if it worked in a way that when you are living a life you don&rsquo;t remember your past lives, and like when you die in one life maybe there is like an intermediate period where you return to your full, complete self in the void and you remember all of the lives that you&rsquo;ve lived until that moment, and then you go into another life.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 22, 2021</time>

My experience with this is not universal, but I feel like it&rsquo;s probably in the majority. In my life, several things that I&rsquo;ve really wanted to happen have happened, but probably more have not happened.
I did not go to a D1 college to play tennis.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 21, 2021</time>

Maybe less, but it feels like a long time. I was doing them really consistently for more than a month so going more than like 2-3 days feels like ages.
Which is good, because it means I&rsquo;m noticing the lack of them in my routine and it&rsquo;s making me want to come back to writing them. I think that&rsquo;s the sign of a habit that will stick around for a while.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 21, 2021</time>

It&rsquo;s a phrase I invoke when someone is not sure that we&rsquo;re doing the right thing because results haven&rsquo;t materialized yet. And the idea behind trusting the process is that the process make sense from first principles. The results will come because we can predict from first principles that this process will generate those results.
It&rsquo;s a good mental model for doing things that take a long time.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 10, 2021</time>

I thought it would be good to do a reflection on what it&rsquo;s been like so far.
For starters, I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;m still doing it! I start lots of projects and I also quit lots of projects before they become anything significant. I know it&rsquo;s all relative, but writing 25,000 words of stream of consciousness journalling over the course of about a month is significant to me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 8, 2021</time>

I&rsquo;m kind of settling into my &ldquo;explore&rdquo; phase. I wrote about this a few entries back, but basically I want to spend some time looking for the next fulfilling thing to do with my life.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 4, 2021</time>

As it to say you would have been able to do a good job, if it were not for the short comings of these tools which you did not make and so are not accountable for.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 29, 2021</time>

Or I guess even just someone who has been reading a lot for a while. It makes them different than other people. I&rsquo;m not sure what the difference is, but I feel like it&rsquo;s real.
Now, reading a lot is relative. I think I used to read a lot, probably hit 40 or 50 books a year at my peak in late middle school, early high school.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 29, 2021</time>

At least in the way I&rsquo;m usually building something, which is writing a lot of code and making it run on the internet.
In the past couple weeks, and going forward for an indefinite amount of time, I&rsquo;ll be just searching, chilling, playing, thinking. The idea is that I&rsquo;ll find some object level thing I&rsquo;m interested in pursuing.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 27, 2021</time>
