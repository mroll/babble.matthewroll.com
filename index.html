048 - Writers Block
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I have writer&rsquo;s block so much as I don&rsquo;t know how to write what I want to write. That&rsquo;s not what I think of as writer&rsquo;s block, anyway. What writer&rsquo;s block is to me is the inability write, period.
Which is not what I have because I&rsquo;ve actually been writing a fair amount all the way through this whole thing of not being able to write.
I keep coming back to the thing Sasha Chapin wrote about &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo; which is that if you have writer&rsquo;s block then it&rsquo;s because you are embarrassed about what you think about, or something like that.</p>

047 - One of Those People With an Easy Life
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Everyone knows they&rsquo;re out there, but unless they tell you, or you get to know them really well, you won&rsquo;t know for sure who they are. I&rsquo;m talking about people with easy lives.
People who seem to move about the world with a fluidity and a lightness that doesn&rsquo;t seem fair if you&rsquo;re one of those people who does not have an easy life.
And the thing is: it&rsquo;s not fair.</p>

046 - The Purpose of a Modern Junto
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>So I&rsquo;m reading Ben Franklin&rsquo;s Autobiography, and it&rsquo;s really good. It honestly reads like a novel. His early life was quite adventurous and he traveled widely, became acquainted with people in high places, and set out on his own in business.
I really admire his intelligence and the way he plays the game of life.
One thing he does upon making it back to Philadelphia after his year long stay in London is start a social/intellectual club called the Junto.</p>

045 - Hosting Stuff
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Hosting people at my apartment is something I&rsquo;ve just recently discovered I really enjoy. It might have something to do with the fact that only now do I have an apartment that is big enough to properly have people over. We have a dedicated living room, not just a corner of the studio where the couch is. And we have a bar area where we can prepare drinks, and we have a pretty big open floor in the middle of the apartment where we can put out a table and chairs to seat eight people.</p>

044 - Outlook Axes
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I consider myself an optimist, but I also have low expectations for people in general. Like I don&rsquo;t think people in general are smart or conscientious. Sometimes this confuses people because how can you be an optimist and also think so little of people?
The way I reconcile this for myself is that optimism and cynicism fall on orthogonal axes. Sliding your position across one does not have to change your position on the other.</p>

043 - Something of a Life Plan
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;ve thought a fair amount about over the past few years but haven&rsquo;t put into writing as far as I can remember is my high level, general life plan for the next ten years.
It&rsquo;s not super detailed and doesn&rsquo;t cover everything in life, and actually now that I think about it it&rsquo;s actually mostly just about making money. But since what I do to make money and how much money I make has a massive impact on how I live my life and what options are open for living my life, I kind of think of it as a general life plan.</p>

<p>Sasha Chapin says that if you think you have writer&rsquo;s block you actually are just lying to yourself about who you are and what you think about. That if you feel like you don&rsquo;t have anything to write about, you&rsquo;re wrong because obviously there are thoughts floating around in your head and you should just look at them and put them down on paper roughly in the order they occur to you.</p>

041 - Welcome Back

<div>
<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;ve been on something of a hiatus from this thing. I wrote the last post sitting at the San Francisco airport waiting for the flight that would take me back to the east coast for the foreseeable future. (And honestly I can&rsquo;t see myself living on the west coast again.)
That kicked off a move to New York City that has taken up pretty much 100% of my time since then.</p>

<p>Today is my last day in California. I&rsquo;m sitting in the SFO airport waiting for my flight back east to board. Figured it was a good time to write a word vomit. Maybe process some stuff that I&rsquo;m feeling.
The thing is I&rsquo;m not feeling anything significant. I&rsquo;m excited to go back east, back home, is really how I think about it. I never got to feel like Cali was home.</p>

039 - Getting Good at Programming

</h2>
<div>
<p>I will just say off the bat that I am a little bit nervous to write this one and I don&rsquo;t really know what I am going to say. Because getting good at programming is something I feel in my bones, rather than something that I know how to articulate to people.
What does getting good at programming feel like? I mean I guess it feels like being able to write code for an hour without running it and be confident that you are going in the right direction.</p>
