I don&rsquo;t know what the right thing is, and maybe I am doing things that are bringing me closer to it, but it doesn&rsquo;t always feel like it.
Maybe it felt like it when I won the $100 BTC from the most recent 1729 task. Because one thing I want to be good at is writing on the internet, and winning money by writing good things on the internet seems like nice validation of that goal.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 17, 2021</time>

What is &ldquo;activation energy&rdquo; in this context? It&rsquo;s the energy you need to muster to start doing some task. Usually it&rsquo;s a work thing, like sitting down to work in the morning, or doing a chore like washing the dishes, or doing your taxes, or working out.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 14, 2021</time>

Like it&rsquo;s actually an extension of your body or mind and it&rsquo;s kind of weird because we are all on the same internet and so we share this extension of our mind.
Everyone has different experiences on the internet, so it&rsquo;s not the same extension for everyone.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 12, 2021</time>

I just kind of went to school and played tennis (so I guess I&rsquo;m talking from like 5 years old to maybe 11 or 12), hung out with friends, read books. Looking back I basically consider myself a biological machine responding mechanically to the inputs of my environment. There was very little of what I would now call &ldquo;free will&rdquo; or &ldquo;rational agency&rdquo; going into my decisions about what I liked or how I liked to spend my time.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 10, 2021</time>

I&rsquo;m not sure I have a great definition of even what it means, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not that good at it. I&rsquo;m always thinking about the future. Mostly I&rsquo;m thinking about projects I have going on and what&rsquo;s the next step that I can work on to make progress. And I even spend a lot of time brainstorming potential projects.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 8, 2021</time>

I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I think and as part of it I did a lot of running.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 6, 2021</time>

For me, at least. I realize that&rsquo;s not how other people relate to food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for improvement there.
I don&rsquo;t want my relationship with food to be that it&rsquo;s an afterthought. I don&rsquo;t want to not spend time on food.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 4, 2021</time>

It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s stuff inside my head that' making me tired? I don&rsquo;t know how that works. It feels like if I just get it out then my mind will be more clear and I&rsquo;ll be more with it. I&rsquo;ll have more clarity. Feel lighter in my body.
Part of the problem no doubt is that I ate a bunch of pasta for lunch.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 2, 2021</time>

When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &ldquo;birth name&rdquo; or &ldquo;given name&rdquo; or &ldquo;state name&rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &ldquo;Matt Roll&rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 2, 2021</time>

Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it.
