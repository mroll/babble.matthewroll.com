When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my &ldquo;birth name&rdquo; or &ldquo;given name&rdquo; or &ldquo;state name&rdquo;, I realize that names are not special. Like, &ldquo;Matt Roll&rdquo; is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 2, 2021</time>

Some activity you do just for fun, not for any future gain. Well, maybe you think there is future gain, like it you get really good at the hobby then it will be more enjoyable to practice it. But not future gain as in you think you will be able to like sell your paintings for lots of money and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to realize your financial life goals.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 30, 2021</time>

Ah, ok, that&rsquo;s already not true. In eighth grade I decided for some deranged reason that only makes sense in the mind of a teenager that I wanted to be popular. And so I started putting a lot of effort into becoming friends with the popular kids. I&rsquo;m not even sure at this point how I bootstrapped that endeavor.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 29, 2021</time>

At some point that year I also found out about bitcoin, which was obviously like the ideas in Cryptonomicon manifest in the real world. Real world digital gold. I thought it was really cool, and I tried to download the software and start mining bitcoin from my laptop in my freshman dorm room.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 27, 2021</time>

It was freshman year of college, and the dining hall had free coffee, and I would take it with some cream and sugar. My friend Joe and I would kind of bond over coffee, I think he was already a coffee drinker and the reason I took an interest to it might have been a way to have something we could share and talk about.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 26, 2021</time>

I don&rsquo;t have any coherent positions on &ldquo;education&rdquo; mostly because it just doesn&rsquo;t have any crisp meaning in my head.
Ok, what are the concepts that I associate with the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;?
First is the school system in the United States. I get a sort of visual of lots of different school units spread over a large geography when I think of the term &ldquo;education&rdquo;, and I think that&rsquo;s how my mind manifests the idea of the United States primary school system.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 25, 2021</time>

A project to write a million words. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if those words are good, mediocre, amazing, or awful. It just matters that they exist. Because if they exist, it means I forced my brain to make a million words come out of my brain, through my fingers and the keyboard, into a computer, and onto the internet. And if that has happened, then I&rsquo;ve probably learned a few things about myself, about writing, about consistency, about practice.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 24, 2021</time>
