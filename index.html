042 - What I Think About

<p>Sasha Chapin says that if you think you have writer&rsquo;s block you actually are just lying to yourself about who you are and what you think about. That if you feel like you don&rsquo;t have anything to write about, you&rsquo;re wrong because obviously there are thoughts floating around in your head and you should just look at them and put them down on paper roughly in the order they occur to you.</p>

041 - Welcome Back
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;ve been on something of a hiatus from this thing. I wrote the last post sitting at the San Francisco airport waiting for the flight that would take me back to the east coast for the foreseeable future. (And honestly I can&rsquo;t see myself living on the west coast again.)
That kicked off a move to New York City that has taken up pretty much 100% of my time since then.</p>

040 - Moving on From California
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Today is my last day in California. I&rsquo;m sitting in the SFO airport waiting for my flight back east to board. Figured it was a good time to write a word vomit. Maybe process some stuff that I&rsquo;m feeling.
The thing is I&rsquo;m not feeling anything significant. I&rsquo;m excited to go back east, back home, is really how I think about it. I never got to feel like Cali was home.</p>

039 - Getting Good at Programming
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>I will just say off the bat that I am a little bit nervous to write this one and I don&rsquo;t really know what I am going to say. Because getting good at programming is something I feel in my bones, rather than something that I know how to articulate to people.
What does getting good at programming feel like? I mean I guess it feels like being able to write code for an hour without running it and be confident that you are going in the right direction.</p>

038 - On Taste
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is a great Ira Glass quote about taste and how you build it. It rings true to my experience. Basically it says that even people with killer taste cannot produce up to their own standards when they are just starting out. They have a vision for something great, and they try to build it, but it turns out inevitably to look like shit.
This can be discouraging, but fear not, goes the quote.</p>

037 - Maybe I Should Just Get Started

<div>
<p>I have this idea that I&rsquo;ll eventually start some big project that will be really technically interesting and challenging, and I&rsquo;ll work on it for years and it will pay my bills and maybe even make me rich.
I&rsquo;m currently not doing that, like not doing any work on that, because I feel like I have to do something else first. I feel like I have to do some sort of stepping stone project.</p>

036 - The Writing Brain I'm Trying to Build
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>There is a type of brain that can just push words out onto the page at an alarming rate with relative ease. I want that brain. I don&rsquo;t currently have that brain, but this project is me putting time and energy directly toward a future where that is the brain I have. I just think there is so much interesting stuff that gets lost because only so much can fit inside your head and so you eventually forget and move onto other interesting things without properly documenting what you were thinking about previously.</p>

035 - Writing Fiction
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiction is what got me into reading. As a kid I fell in love with stories written down as words on pages. I think this is a pretty common theme among people who love reading, but something about books is magical. And I saw that magic early on.
At some point, I think maybe it was middle school, I got into science fiction. I don&rsquo;t know what the first science fiction I read was.</p>

034 - Identity as a Writer
</a>
</h2>
<div>
<p>What makes someone &ldquo;a writer.&rdquo; Like, being &ldquo;a writer&rdquo; is an occupation, certainly. If you have been paid for something you wrote then you can consider yourself a writer. Actually as I write that I realize that I have been paid for something I wrote: $100 BTC for a blog post reviewing Balaji Srinivasan&rsquo;s post on network states.
If you get paid to write a book, or if you are regularly paid to write articles for a website, you are a writer.</p>

033 - Moving

<div>
<p>We just decided, yesterday, to move to New York City a month earlier than we had originally planned. Actually maybe two months earlier? Anyway, the point is we are starting the process right now, like today. We are selling most of our stuff, packing up the rest, and leaving California at the end of June. We are not coming back. Our apartment will be leased until the end of September, but we just want to get out and get to the city as soon as possible.</p>
