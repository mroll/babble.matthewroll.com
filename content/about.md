This is a project to write 1,000,000 words. 

I feel like I have a lot to say, both because there are things I want
to share and because there are things I think I will only figure out
through the course of writing.

But at the moment it's difficult for me to get ideas out of my head
and onto the page. The ideas in my head feel like water, and they are
trying to flow downstream to the page, but the stream is not wide
enough, or there is blockage, like sticks and leaves keeping the
idea-water from moving quickly through the channel.

I am pretty sure I know how to remove that blockage: write 1,000,000
words. A brute force method that just keeps moving idea-water through
that channel, slowly forcing out the sticks and leaves and even
widening the channel to support more bandwidth.

The key here is that those million words don't need to be very
good. In fact there is probably a fair amount to gain by writing a
bunch of crap; learning to recognize it and the motions that produce
it will serve to refine my taste and help me avoid it in the future.

This project takes inspiration and structure from
[@visakanv](http://visakanv.com/1000/). The goal is to put together a
collection of 1,000 stream-of-consciousness word vomits, each ~1,000
words long.
