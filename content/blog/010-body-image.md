Body image is something I haven't really had to think serious about
before. I consider this a lucky accident mostly. I was born with good
genes and started effectively working out extremely hard when I was
like 12. My sport was tennis, I think around 11 or 12 was when I
started going to a tennis clinic once a week. It was for 2 hours I
think and as part of it I did a lot of running.

I played a lot of tennis other than that, too. Occasionally pick up
with friends, and weekend tournaments. I did various cross-training
programs over the years in middle school and high school.

And in the summers I played almost every day and did intense cardio
and sprints as part of the training.

I never had a lot of fat on my body as a result. And I liked
that. Being strong and fit is a massive life hack, in my opinion. At
least my experience of being healthy most of my life is that it
physically feels great, and I can only really imagine what it's like
to not be that way.

In college I mostly stopped playing tennis. I didn't make any varsity
teams and club tennis I couldn't make myself go to that often maybe
3-4 times per month. And it wasn't great exercise because we had only
a couple courts and there were a lot of people so we mostly did games.

I went to the gym sporadically throughout college, mostly when I
caught a look of myself in the mirror and decided I didn't like the
chub I was developing in my belly. But I had basically zero discipline
for anything in college except drinking shitty beer on the weekends,
so the gym energy never lasted long.

But remarkably, especially because of the diet I kept during college,
I managed to mostly keep my shape. My belly only ever grew to a
certain point that was mostly not noticeable. I still looked fit.

I'm almost 27 now, and I think my good luck is over. I haven't been
working out consistently since graduating college, and I've gone
through stretches of not eating very well. Especially over the past
six months, I've been eating a lot of takeout and started to see my
belly grow to previously unseen levels.

It's not that bad, as far as the impact on my emotions or sense of
identity or anything. It's more like, "wow, I really like being fit
and I don't like this new development. I should probably do something
about it." It's a really good motivator to start working out
consistently again. To introduce some discipline into my life. Wow,
somehow everything I write about comes back to the same few
themes. That's probably a known phenomenon in journalling. Anyway.

Let's talk about discipline, and hopefully somewhat stay on topic.

I shunned discipline consciously starting when I entered college. I
had developed a love for programming and saw myself as a typical
hacker type who was lazy but smart and productive nonetheless, because
writing code was fun. I think this attitude got me pretty far and is
the main factor in why I was actually decent at programming when I
graduated. Unlike anyone who graduated with me and had just followed
the curriculum the whole time. Sorry, I digress. I just like to take
pot shots at traditional education.

The point is I purposefully had no discipline because I thought it was
counterproductive to innovation and happiness. Like I said that was
fine for a few years because I was not living in the real world.

That even served me alright for a couple years after college, since I
was mature enough to keep my life in order and hold down a good job.

But now there are things that I can't do without discipline. Staying
fit and healthy is one of them. I don't want to not like how I
look. But I know that I'll grow fat if I don't change something. And
that change won't happen on its own. I won't just all of a sudden
develop a burning love for working out. I won't consistently find time
for it if I don't accept that it's a hard thing to do. In short, it
won't happen if I'm not disciplined about it.

And the thing is, I'm finding I love the idea of introducing more
discipline into my life. I think I got a lot out of the period of my
life where I was decidedly undisciplined. It gave me time to explore
the world of programming, the web, startups, various social scenes. I
learned a skill that puts food on the table and a roof over my
head. It gave me a foundation that I can use as a platform for the
next stage.

That next stage is stuff that requires discipline. Stuff like getting
in shape and staying in shape. Stuff like getting good at writing and
producing a lot of written words to put online.

I didn't really think that I would get to a stage like this. Like,
when I was purposefully shunning discipline, I thought that was a
perfectly good life philosophy that would serve me well for
decades. Only in the last year have I realized that to do the next set
of hard things that I want to accomplish do I need to shift my
thinking on how hard things get done. Sometimes you have to do things
you don't want. Even if you're tired and sore, you roll out of bed and
get to that work out because you have a goal of hitting X workouts in
Y days.

I have a much greater respect for producing a voluminous amount of
work because I realize that volume is what shapes taste and builds the
muscle memory and frees up the mind and body to eventually put out
quality that wouldn't be possible without mountains of crap.
