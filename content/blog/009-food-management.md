Food is one of those things that's just in the background of life. For
me, at least. I realize that's not how other people relate to
food. But at the moment, food is a necessity but not something I like
spending time thinking about and managing. But I see room for
improvement there.

I don't want my relationship with food to be that it's an
afterthought. I don't want to not spend time on food. Or, rather, I
want my food management to be good, but I would probably like to have
good food management without spending a lot of time on it.

Because I have bigger things to do. Food isn't something that I can
build on. I get hungry, then I eat, then I can get back to things I'm
more interested in. I would like to have a better diet than I do
now. I would like to eat a wider range of foods, I would like to eat
healthier, but I don't want to treat food management as a constant
project in my life that takes multiple hours per week.

I think I know how that's possible. M and I have an idea for an app
that implements a simple system of deciding what to eat for the week
and putting together a shopping list. The key is that it stores
recipes for you, so that you don't have to spend time thinking up
options right before you go to the grocery store, which is what we do
now.

We have an extremely limited diet because we don't write down
recipes. And we don't look for and try recipes, so our options don't
expand. I think we would look for and try new recipes if we felt like
we had a place to record ones that we think are good. If we don't feel
like a new recipe is going to put a burden on our brains, then we
would probably incorporate more experimentation and branching out into
our food management. As it is, we have a boring diet of like four
dishes.

The other thing about food management, aside from coming up with stuff
to eat and buying it, is cooking it. Cooking food at home is way
healthier than eating out, but it takes a lot of time. Like an hour
per dish on average for the dishes we eat. And we never feel like
doing it. It's work, and it has to happen outside of our "working
hours" we spend on our job, which are hours that we want to not have
any obligations. We want to be able to just do what we want, whether
it's reading, watching tv, working on a project, etc. Cooking is a
chore.

I'm not sure how to fix this issue. Is there a way we can turn cooking
into "not a chore"? Maybe. I don't know what it is. It's probably not
as simple as telling ourselves not to think of cooking as a
chore. It's probably more like deciding to work cooking into our
routine and committing to that for a couple months. Then once we
realize that we can work with that routine, we become less opposed to
it and it starts to feel like a regular manageable part of our
life. That's what I would try first, anyway.

I think cooking is necessary. Maybe meal prep kits like Blue Apron or
Hello Fresh would help make cooking faster and keep it
healthy. Potential options there.

I get excited thinking about trying more dishes and expanding my
diet. Like I said, we don't eat a wide range of things. We eat mostly
Indian food and we eat like at most four dishes: paneer (2-3 kinds),
dal, sabzi, and chana. They are all high effort things to make,
meaning you have to cut up multiple kinds of vegetables and cook them
with spices. Ok, dal by itself is easy to make, but you don't _just_
make dal. You make it with sabzi or something.

I want to do some food exploring because I think there are dishes out
there that we would really like and that take less effort to
cook. Like, Indian food almost as a rule involves combining a bunch of
vegetables and spices into one mush and cooking it all together. I
think other cultures have dishes that involve fewer ingredients and
don't involve so much cooking time to combine. I'm thinking like
salads and stuff, but I don't actually know. That's kind of the point
here.

We will probably end up doing this exploring next year or the year
after. I think there is too much else we are trying to figure out
right now. It kind of has to be a concerted effort, changing your food
management, since it's a core routine that affects the way you do and
manage other things in your life. But I'm hopeful. We will get there.

One thing we have down about food management is keeping the kitchen
clean. This is weirdly a topic I get excited about. I'm responsible
for keeping the kitchen clean, and I use the time as a sort of
meditative ritual where I listen to podcasts and relax while doing
this totally mechanical grunt work. Division of chores in a
relationship is really important in my opinion, and you should do some
work between the two of you to figure out who likes doing what. And
who doesn't like doing what. M really doesn't like cleaning the dishes
so I'm in charge of that.

If I didn't have that chore, I probably wouldn't have any time to set
life aside the way it lets me do so. I'm not sure what I'm trying to
say here, just that since it's a necessity to keep the kitchen clean
it removes any guilt about not being productive. Which damn when I say
that I realize I am way too hardcore about being productive. What can
I say, I'm working on it.
