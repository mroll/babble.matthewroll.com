Pseudonymity is being known under a name different than your given name. When I think about names, and being known under a different name than my "birth name" or "given name" or "state name", I realize that names are not special. Like, "Matt Roll" is not more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. I mean ok, maybe there is a good case at this moment in 2021 why my given name is more special than some name I make up and use to talk to people online. Reason being I can like get a bank account and get hired and rent an apartment and buy a house and all that with my given name. And I can't do that with my Twitter handle.

But all that is changing.

Crypto means I can make up a name and act under it online, and even in the real world I think, and have the same capabilities as my given name. I like calling it "state name" because that makes it clear who cares about the name. The state. The government. The Man. Fuck the Man.

The Man keeps track of your credit score and refuses you opportunities if it's not good enough. There are surely better ways of assessing peoples' ability to pay a debt over time. When I had just graduated college, I had never had a credit card. The idea of spending money I didn't have just seemed so dumb. Like, why would anyone ever do that? What if something happened and you couldn't pay it back in time? That would just be awful and it's just so avoidable.

Anyway. Pseudonymity. I'm still breaking my mind into the concept. I'm still not completely there yet. Haven't grasped all the implications. There are many. It changes your understanding of the world, and how you view yourself, and what you think are reasonable ways of acting and speaking and working in public.

Let me try to explain. In the professional working world, especially now that that world is majorly online, there is a reputation associated with your state name. You use your state name on your LinkedIn profile. Lots of people have Twitter accounts that use their state name, and they use those accounts to accumulate reputation points. Basically, are you saying smart things that don't cross the Overton Window boundaries too hard?

If you take peoples' online personas as they are represented in these places alongside their state names, you get a certain picture of who they are and what they believe. But that is an imperfect model for a very specific and important reason: they are only saying what they think is ok to say and have be associated with their state name. Their livelihood and their social standing, and their safety in many cases, is dependent on the reputation associated with their state name.

So there is a massively powerful filter that is invisibly sitting between peoples' brains and what they put out online under their state name.

That's obviously imperfect! At no point in history has the Overton Window been a one-to-one mapping with the set of true ideas. If you only allow conversation that discusses things that are acceptable given the current political climate, then you are going to miss true ideas, and you are going to settle on untrue ideas. There is some formal set theory that I'm gesturing at here but this is a word vomit and I'm not going to take the time to develop it here. But it's there.

Anyway. What does this have to do with pseudonymity? Well, if you have important things to say that you don't want to associate with your state name, you create a pseudonym. You create an alt twitter account, you create a blog and don't put your real name on it, you create a substack and don't put your real name on it. This is actually a really powerful idea and it's not new. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and other wrote _The Federalist Papers_ as pseudonymous essays in order to avoid the consequences of publishing under their state names.

So if it's not a new idea, why do I care about it now? One reason is that I'm just now figuring out how I want to present myself in public on the internet. I certainly think things that I want to publish but I don't want to publish under my state name. There is a certain audience I have in mind when I publish things under my state name. I carefully curate the things I say to that audience, because that affects how those people see me, and the way those people see me influences my professional opportunities which are rather important to me at the moment, not being rich yet.

But yeah so I have things I want to say that I don't want people to see associated with my state name. And the answer seems to be pseudonymous accounts. Make a Twitter account with a name and aesthetic you like, and start posting a more unfiltered stream under that name.

I always think of Valentine and Peter posting as Demosthenes and Locke from Ender's Game.

Ok there is another reason why I think this is an important topic now. Crypto is coming into its own. It's still super early, to be sure, and lots of the foundational technology is still to be figured out, but the ideas are there and we can start to see what the world will look like when these ideas spread and the tech becomes mainstream.

Crypto means you can own a name in a way that has not been possible before. Crypto makes it harder to steal identities than the current state based system that relies on social security numbers and knowing your address and shit. If you cryptographically own a name, then there is no question that it's you acting under that name.

Now ok, maybe identity theft is not such a big problem that crypto will revolutionize things in this way. But there's another reason. Crypto means you can transfer reputation. If you build up a bunch of reputation under your state name (or another name, doesn't matter), you can transfer that reputation to a pseudonym where you say unfiltered and controversial things, and people will take them seriously because the reputation is there. And the reputation is unfakable. A lot of reputation means people have trusted and/or enjoyed the things you have said, even under many different names.

It means you can consolidate reputation. Like, maybe you have X reputation under your state name, and Y reputation under a name that advocates for Uighur rights in China, and you live in China, so obviously you're not saying these things under your state name. That would be suicide. You can transfer your Y Uighur-advocating reputation to your state account to augment that reputation, and you can transfer your X state name reputation to your Uighur-advocating account to augment that. And so the work that you do under both accounts is counted for both accounts.
